### what is java

Java is a **high-level, object-oriented programming language** widely used for developing various types of applications. It was developed by **James Gosling** at Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) and released in 1995. Java is known for its simplicity, platform independence, robustness, and vast ecosystem.

### Key Features of Java:

1. **Platform Independence**:
   Java's "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) capability allows Java programs to run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This is achieved through bytecode, an intermediate representation of Java code.

2. **Object-Oriented**:
   Java supports key object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.

3. **Robust and Secure**:
   Java includes features like automatic memory management (garbage collection), exception handling, and type checking to create robust and secure applications.

4. **Multithreading**:
   Java provides built-in support for multithreaded programming, enabling developers to create applications that can perform multiple tasks simultaneously.

5. **Rich API**:
   Java offers an extensive set of libraries for various tasks such as data structures, networking, database connectivity, and GUI development.

6. **Distributed Computing**:
   Java's support for distributed systems (e.g., using RMI and EJB) makes it suitable for building enterprise-grade applications.

7. **High Performance**:
   Although not as fast as native languages like C++, Java's performance has significantly improved with Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers and other optimizations.

### Common Applications of Java:

1. **Web Applications**: Using frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, and Struts.
2. **Mobile Applications**: Primarily for Android development using Android SDK.

### what is JVM

The **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** is the runtime environment in the Java ecosystem. It plays a crucial role in enabling Java's platform independence by executing compiled Java programs. The JVM is responsible for interpreting Java bytecode (compiled Java code) and converting it into machine-specific instructions for the underlying hardware.

### Key Components of the JVM:

1. **Class Loader**:
   Loads Java class files (bytecode) into the JVM and ensures the required classes are available. It handles tasks like linking and initialization of classes.

2. **Bytecode Verifier**:
   Verifies the correctness and safety of the bytecode to ensure it adheres to the Java specification. This prevents malicious code from being executed.

3. **Interpreter**:
   Interprets bytecode and translates it into machine instructions at runtime. This ensures portability across different platforms.

4. **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler**:
   Enhances performance by converting frequently executed bytecode into native machine code, which speeds up execution.

5. **Garbage Collector (GC)**:
   Automatically manages memory by reclaiming unused objects, reducing the risk of memory leaks.

6. **Runtime Data Areas**:
    - **Heap**: Stores objects and class-level variables.
    - **Stack**: Stores method-specific data such as local variables and method calls.
    - **Method Area**: Contains metadata about classes, methods, and constants.
    - **Program Counter (PC) Register**: Tracks the address of the current instruction being executed.
    - **Native Method Stack**: Handles native methods (written in languages like C or C++).

### How JVM Works:

1. **Compilation**:
   Java source code (`.java` files) is compiled by the Java Compiler (`javac`) into bytecode (`.class` files).

2. **Class Loading**:
   The JVM loads the compiled `.class` files into memory through the Class Loader.

3. **Bytecode Execution**:
   The JVM executes the bytecode. The Interpreter interprets it line-by-line, while the JIT Compiler optimizes performance by converting frequently executed code into native instructions.

4. **Memory Management**:
   The Garbage Collector manages memory by automatically deallocating unused objects.

### Diagram of the Java Execution Process:

### JVM vs JRE vs JDK:

- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: Executes bytecode.
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: Includes the JVM and libraries required to run Java applications.
- **JDK (Java Development Kit)**: Includes the JRE and development tools like `javac`, debugger, and tools for building Java applications.

### Key JVM Implementations:

- Oracle HotSpot JVM
- OpenJ9 (IBM)
- GraalVM

The JVM's versatility and optimization capabilities make Java a powerful language for building robust and platform-independent applications.

### what is JRE

The **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** is a software package that provides everything needed to run Java applications. It includes the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**, libraries, and other components that help execute Java programs. While the JVM is responsible for running Java bytecode, the JRE provides all the necessary resources, such as class libraries and other tools, to support the execution of Java programs.

### Key Components of JRE:
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: Executes the compiled Java bytecode.
- **Libraries**: A set of pre-written code that provides functionality (like input/output, networking, etc.).
- **Other Resources**: Includes things like fonts, graphics, and configuration files.

### JRE vs JDK:
- **JRE**: Used to **run** Java applications.
- **JDK (Java Development Kit)**: Includes the JRE along with tools for developing Java applications, such as the compiler (`javac`).

In short, **JRE** is all you need to **run** Java programs, while the **JDK** is for **developing** Java programs.

### How many types of memory areas are allocated by JVM?

The **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** allocates several types of memory areas to manage the execution of Java programs. These areas are used for storing different types of data, such as classes, methods, and objects. Here are the main types of memory areas allocated by the JVM:

### 1. **Heap**:
- **Purpose**: Stores **objects** and **arrays** created during the execution of a program.
- **Garbage Collection**: The heap is managed by the garbage collector, which automatically reclaims memory by removing unused objects.
- **Example**: When you create a new object in Java using `new`, it’s stored in the heap.

### 2. **Stack**:
- **Purpose**: Stores **method calls**, **local variables**, and **method-specific data**.
- **Size**: Each thread in the program has its own stack, and the size of the stack is determined at the time of creation.
- **Example**: When a method is called, its local variables and function calls are stored in the stack.

### 3. **Method Area**:
- **Purpose**: Stores **class-level data**, such as class definitions, method definitions, static variables, and constant pool data.
- **Example**: Information about the methods and fields of a class is stored here.

### 4. **Program Counter (PC) Register**:
- **Purpose**: Holds the address of the **currently executing instruction**.
- **Example**: For each thread, the program counter keeps track of where the thread is in execution.

### 5. **Native Method Stack**:
- **Purpose**: Stores information for native (non-Java) methods written in languages like C or C++.
- **Example**: If a Java program calls a native method, it uses the native method stack.

### Summary:
The JVM uses the following memory areas:
1. **Heap**: For objects and arrays.
2. **Stack**: For method calls and local variables.
3. **Method Area**: For class-level data and methods.
4. **Program Counter (PC) Register**: For tracking the current instruction.
5. **Native Method Stack**: For native method calls.

Each of these areas plays a role in managing memory and helping the JVM run Java applications efficiently.

### What is JIT compiler?

The **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler** is a part of the **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** that improves the performance of Java programs by converting Java bytecode into **native machine code** at runtime, instead of interpreting it line by line. This compilation happens **just in time** as the code is needed, rather than beforehand.

### How JIT Works:
1. **Initial Execution**: When a Java program runs, the JVM initially interprets the bytecode (which is slower).
2. **JIT Compilation**: As the program continues to run, the JIT compiler identifies frequently used methods or code (often called **hot spots**) and compiles them into native machine code.
3. **Reuse**: Once compiled, the machine code is cached, so it can be reused in future executions, improving performance.

### Benefits of JIT:
- **Improved Performance**: By compiling bytecode into native code, JIT improves the execution speed of Java programs.
- **Adaptive Optimization**: The JIT compiler can optimize code based on the actual execution patterns, making it more efficient over time.

### Example:
- The first time you run a method in Java, it might be interpreted. But the next time it's called, the JIT compiler will have compiled it into faster machine code, speeding up its execution.

In short, the **JIT compiler** helps **Java** run faster by converting bytecode to machine code during execution, allowing for performance optimizations as the program runs.

### What is classloader?

A **ClassLoader** is a part of the **JVM** responsible for loading Java classes into memory at runtime. It loads **class files** (with a `.class` extension) from various sources (e.g., disk, network, etc.) and makes them available for use by the program. The ClassLoader is an essential part of Java's dynamic class loading mechanism, enabling Java applications to load and use classes as needed during execution.

### Key Functions of ClassLoader:
1. **Loading Classes**: The ClassLoader loads the class bytecode into memory from its location, which can be a file, a network location, or any other source.
2. **Linking Classes**: It verifies and prepares the class for use in the Java program.
3. **Initializing Classes**: It initializes the class, i.e., sets up static variables and static blocks.

### Types of ClassLoaders in JVM:
1. **Bootstrap ClassLoader**:
    - **Purpose**: It loads core Java libraries (e.g., `rt.jar`) that are part of the JDK, like `java.lang`, `java.util`.
    - **Location**: It is part of the JVM and doesn't have a parent ClassLoader.

2. **Extension ClassLoader**:
    - **Purpose**: It loads classes from the JDK extensions directory (e.g., libraries in the `jre/lib/ext` folder).
    - **Location**: It has the Bootstrap ClassLoader as its parent.

3. **System ClassLoader (or Application ClassLoader)**:
    - **Purpose**: It loads classes from the application's classpath (e.g., JAR files, directories specified in the `CLASSPATH` environment variable).
    - **Location**: This is typically the ClassLoader used in most applications.

4. **Custom ClassLoader**:
    - Developers can create their own ClassLoader to load classes from custom locations or sources (e.g., remote servers or encrypted files).

### ClassLoader Hierarchy:
ClassLoaders form a **parent-child** hierarchy:
- **Bootstrap ClassLoader** (top-level, no parent).
- **Extension ClassLoader** (child of Bootstrap).
- **System ClassLoader** (child of Extension).

When a class is requested, the JVM starts by asking the parent ClassLoader to load the class and follows the hierarchy until it finds or fails to load the class.

### Example:
```java
ClassLoader classLoader = SomeClass.class.getClassLoader();
System.out.println(classLoader);  // This will print the class loader used for "SomeClass"
```

### Summary:
The **ClassLoader** is responsible for dynamically loading Java classes during runtime. It helps in modularizing the application, enabling the JVM to load and use classes from different sources and locations.

### What is the purpose of static methods and variables?

In Java, **static** methods and variables are associated with the **class** itself, rather than with instances (objects) of the class. This means that **static** members are shared among all instances of the class. Here's a breakdown of the purpose and use cases:

### **Static Variables**:
- **Definition**: A static variable is a variable that is shared across all instances of a class. It is declared with the `static` keyword.

- **Purpose**:
    - **Shared Data**: Static variables allow you to store values that are common to all objects of the class.
    - **Memory Efficiency**: Instead of each object having its own copy of a variable, all objects share a single copy of the static variable, saving memory.

- **Example**:
  ```java
  class Counter {
      static int count = 0;  // Static variable

      public Counter() {
          count++;  // Incrementing the static variable for each object created
      }
  }

  public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          new Counter();
          new Counter();
          System.out.println(Counter.count);  // Output will be 2
      }
  }
  ```
  In this example, the `count` variable is shared by all instances of the `Counter` class.

### **Static Methods**:
- **Definition**: A static method is a method that belongs to the class rather than an instance of the class. It can be called without creating an object of the class.

- **Purpose**:
    - **Utility Functions**: Static methods are typically used for utility functions that don't depend on instance-specific data.
    - **Accessing Static Variables**: Static methods can only access other static variables or call other static methods.
    - **No Need for Objects**: You can call static methods directly from the class, without creating an object.

- **Example**:
  ```java
  class MathUtils {
      static int add(int a, int b) {  // Static method
          return a + b;
      }
  }

  public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          int result = MathUtils.add(5, 3);  // Calling static method without creating an object
          System.out.println(result);  // Output will be 8
      }
  }
  ```

### **Key Differences Between Static and Instance Members**:
- **Static Variables**: Shared by all objects of the class; one copy exists for the entire class.
- **Instance Variables**: Each object gets its own copy of the variable.
- **Static Methods**: Can be called without creating an object; cannot access non-static (instance) variables or methods directly.
- **Instance Methods**: Must be called on an instance of the class and can access both static and non-static variables.

### Summary:
- **Static Variables**: Store data shared across all instances of a class, useful for maintaining common information (e.g., counters or constants).
- **Static Methods**: Perform operations that do not require instance-specific data, useful for utility functions or operations related to the class as a whole.

### What are the advantages of Packages in Java?

In Java, **packages** are used to group related classes, interfaces, and sub-packages. They help organize code into a namespace, making it easier to manage and maintain. Here are the main advantages of using packages in Java:

### 1. **Organizing Code**:
- Packages allow you to organize related classes and interfaces into namespaces, making your codebase easier to navigate and maintain.
- For example, all database-related classes can be grouped under a `database` package, while utility functions can go into a `utils` package.

### 2. **Avoiding Name Conflicts**:
- Packages help avoid name conflicts by providing a unique namespace for each class. Two classes with the same name can exist in different packages without clashing.
- For example, `com.company.project.Employee` and `com.company.hr.Employee` can both exist without issues.

### 3. **Access Control**:
- Packages provide a way to control access to classes, methods, and variables. The access modifiers (`public`, `protected`, `private`, and package-private) can restrict the visibility of members to other classes in the same package or outside of it.
- For example, a **package-private** member (no access modifier) is only accessible within the same package.

### 4. **Reusability**:
- Packages promote reusability by allowing classes to be grouped logically. Once a package is created, it can be reused in different projects.
- For example, a utility package containing useful methods like date formatting or file handling can be reused across different applications.

### 5. **Namespace Management**:
- Packages provide a mechanism to avoid conflicts between classes, methods, and variables with the same name in different parts of the program. Each class is uniquely identified by its full package name.
- For example, `java.util.Date` and `java.sql.Date` are two different classes with the same name but are in different packages.

### 6. **Improved Code Maintenance**:
- As your application grows, organizing your classes into packages makes it easier to manage and maintain the code. You can group related classes together and apply changes to specific groups without affecting the entire project.
- For example, all classes related to user authentication can be placed in the `authentication` package.

### 7. **Improved Performance**:
- Packages help the Java compiler and runtime to locate classes more easily, which can improve compilation and execution performance, especially in large projects.

### Example of a Package:
```java
// File: com/example/utils/MathUtils.java
package com.example.utils;

public class MathUtils {
    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

```java
// File: com/example/Main.java
package com.example;

import com.example.utils.MathUtils;  // Importing MathUtils from a package

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int result = MathUtils.add(5, 3);  // Calling method from MathUtils
        System.out.println(result);  // Output will be 8
    }
}
```

### Summary of Advantages:
- **Organizing Code**: Helps group related classes logically.
- **Avoiding Name Conflicts**: Prevents name clashes between classes in different packages.
- **Access Control**: Provides access modifiers for managing visibility.
- **Reusability**: Allows easy reuse of classes across different projects.
- **Namespace Management**: Manages naming of classes across the application.
- **Code Maintenance**: Makes large codebases easier to manage.
- **Improved Performance**: Optimizes the locating and loading of classes.

### What is this keyword in java?

In Java, the **`this`** keyword refers to the **current instance** of the class. It is used within an instance method or constructor to refer to the **current object** that is being manipulated or created. The `this` keyword helps to distinguish between instance variables and method parameters that have the same name.

### Key Uses of `this` Keyword:

1. **Referring to Instance Variables**:
    - If the name of an instance variable is the same as the name of a method parameter, you can use `this` to refer to the instance variable to avoid ambiguity.
    - Example:
      ```java
      class Person {
          String name;

          // Constructor
          public Person(String name) {
              this.name = name;  // 'this.name' refers to the instance variable, 'name' refers to the parameter
          }
      }
      ```

2. **Calling Instance Methods**:
    - You can use `this` to explicitly call instance methods from within the current class.
    - Example:
      ```java
      class Car {
          int speed;

          // Method to set speed
          public void setSpeed(int speed) {
              this.speed = speed;  // 'this' is optional here but explicitly used for clarity
          }

          // Method to display speed
          public void displaySpeed() {
              System.out.println("Speed: " + this.speed);  // 'this' refers to the current instance variable
          }
      }
      ```

3. **Calling Another Constructor** (Constructor Chaining):
    - `this()` can be used to call another constructor in the same class. This is known as **constructor chaining**.
    - Example:
      ```java
      class Car {
          String model;
          int year;

          // Constructor 1
          public Car(String model) {
              this(model, 2022);  // Calling another constructor
          }

          // Constructor 2
          public Car(String model, int year) {
              this.model = model;
              this.year = year;
          }
      }
      ```

4. **Passing the Current Object**:
    - You can pass the current object (`this`) as an argument to another method or constructor.
    - Example:
      ```java
      class Printer {
          public void printMessage(String message) {
              System.out.println(message);
          }

          public void printObjectDetails() {
              printMessage(this.toString());  // Passing the current object to another method
          }
      }
      ```

### Example of `this` in Action:
```java
class Book {
    String title;
    String author;

    // Constructor
    public Book(String title, String author) {
        this.title = title;       // Referring to instance variable
        this.author = author;     // Referring to instance variable
    }

    // Method to display book details
    public void displayBookInfo() {
        System.out.println("Title: " + this.title);   // 'this' refers to the current object
        System.out.println("Author: " + this.author); // 'this' refers to the current object
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Book book = new Book("Java Basics", "John Doe");
        book.displayBookInfo();
    }
}
```

### Summary:
- **Refers to the current object**: `this` is used to refer to the current instance of the class.
- **Avoids ambiguity**: It helps distinguish between instance variables and method parameters with the same name.
- **Constructor chaining**: `this()` can be used to call another constructor in the same class.
- **Pass current object**: You can pass the current instance (`this`) to other methods or constructors.

The `this` keyword is important for managing instances and clarifying the scope of variables in your code.

### Can we declare static variables and methods in an abstract class?

Yes, **static variables** and **static methods** can be declared in an **abstract class** in Java.

Here’s how:

### **1. Static Variables in Abstract Class**:
- Static variables belong to the class itself, rather than instances of the class. They can be declared in an abstract class and accessed directly through the class.
- Since static variables are associated with the class, they are shared across all instances of the class (including subclasses).
- Static variables can be **initialized** in the abstract class and used by all its subclasses.

**Example**:
   ```java
   abstract class Animal {
       static int count = 0;  // Static variable

       Animal() {
           count++;  // Increment count every time an object is created
       }

       abstract void makeSound();
   }

   class Dog extends Animal {
       void makeSound() {
           System.out.println("Bark");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Dog d1 = new Dog();
           Dog d2 = new Dog();
           System.out.println(Animal.count);  // Output will be 2, as both Dog objects increment count
       }
   }
   ```

### **2. Static Methods in Abstract Class**:
- Static methods can also be declared in an abstract class. These methods belong to the class, and like static variables, they are shared across all instances and subclasses.
- **Static methods** can be called using the class name without the need to create an instance of the class. However, they **cannot** access instance variables or instance methods directly.
- Static methods are typically used for operations that don't depend on object-specific data.

**Example**:
   ```java
   abstract class Vehicle {
       static void displayType() {  // Static method
           System.out.println("This is a vehicle");
       }

       abstract void start();
   }

   class Car extends Vehicle {
       void start() {
           System.out.println("Car is starting");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Vehicle.displayType();  // Calling static method using class name
           Car c = new Car();
           c.start();
       }
   }
   ```

### Key Points:
- **Static Variables**: Can be declared in an abstract class and are shared across all instances and subclasses.
- **Static Methods**: Can be declared in an abstract class and can be called without creating an instance of the class.
- **Instance Methods**: An abstract class can still have instance methods, and those need to be implemented by subclasses.

### Summary:
- **Yes**, you can declare both **static variables** and **static methods** in an **abstract class**. Static members belong to the class itself and can be accessed without creating an instance. However, they cannot access instance-specific data (non-static members).

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

<hr style="border:1px solid orange">

### Can this keyword be used to refer to static members?

No, the `this` keyword cannot be used to refer to **static members** (static variables or static methods) in Java.

### Reason:
- The `this` keyword refers to the **current instance** of a class. It is used to access instance variables and methods that are associated with a particular object of the class.
- **Static members**, on the other hand, belong to the **class itself** rather than an instance. Static members are shared by all instances of the class, and they can be accessed using the **class name** rather than the `this` keyword.

### Example:
```java
class MyClass {
    static int staticVariable = 10;
    int instanceVariable = 20;

    public void show() {
        System.out.println(this.instanceVariable);  // Refers to instance variable using 'this'
        System.out.println(MyClass.staticVariable); // Refers to static variable using class name
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.show();
    }
}
```

### What Happens Here:
- `this.instanceVariable`: Refers to the **instance variable** using `this` because `instanceVariable` is tied to the particular instance (`obj`) of the class.
- `MyClass.staticVariable`: Refers to the **static variable** using the class name (`MyClass`) because static variables belong to the class itself and not an individual instance.

### Summary:
- **`this` keyword** can only be used to refer to **instance members** (instance variables or instance methods).
- **Static members** should be accessed using the **class name**, not the `this` keyword.
- Using `this` for static members would result in a **compilation error** because `this` refers to the current object, and static members are class-level members that do not require an object.

### Why does Java not support pointers?

Java **does not support pointers** explicitly, unlike languages like C and C++, which use pointers for direct memory manipulation. There are several key reasons why Java does not support pointers:

### 1. **Safety and Security**:
- Pointers in languages like C allow direct memory access, which can be both powerful and dangerous. If a pointer points to an incorrect or invalid memory address, it can lead to **undefined behavior**, such as crashes or data corruption.
- Java eliminates the possibility of such errors by not exposing the concept of pointers directly. It ensures **type safety**, meaning it prevents programs from accessing memory locations that they shouldn't, thus reducing the risk of bugs and vulnerabilities such as **buffer overflows** and **memory leaks**.

### 2. **Automatic Memory Management (Garbage Collection)**:
- Java uses **automatic garbage collection**, which means that memory management (allocation and deallocation) is handled by the JVM. In languages with pointers, programmers need to manually allocate and deallocate memory, which can lead to memory management issues like **memory leaks**.
- Java handles memory management for you, so there's no need for direct manipulation of memory addresses with pointers. The garbage collector automatically reclaims memory that is no longer in use.

### 3. **Abstraction**:
- Java provides a higher level of abstraction compared to languages like C. The idea is to allow programmers to focus more on **application logic** and **business requirements**, without worrying about the underlying memory layout or memory addresses.
- **References** in Java serve as a safer and more abstract way of referring to objects, without exposing the complexities and dangers of pointers. When you assign one object to another in Java, you are copying a reference to the object, not a memory address, making it much safer to work with objects.

### 4. **Portability**:
- Java's design emphasizes **platform independence**, meaning Java programs can run on any platform that has a compatible JVM (Java Virtual Machine). Pointers are platform-specific because memory addresses vary across different systems.
- By removing explicit pointer manipulation, Java avoids the need for system-specific code and ensures that Java programs behave the same way across all platforms, making it **more portable**.

### 5. **Prevention of Common Errors**:
- In languages with pointers, errors such as **null pointer dereferencing** (accessing memory through a pointer that is null) or **dangling pointers** (pointers that reference memory that has been freed) are common.
- Java addresses these issues by introducing the concept of **null references** and providing **NullPointerException** to alert developers when they try to use a reference that is null. However, the language design helps minimize such errors by removing direct memory manipulation altogether.

### 6. **Encapsulation**:
- Java encourages **object-oriented programming** (OOP), and the use of pointers would break the concept of **encapsulation**. Encapsulation refers to keeping an object's data private and safe from external interference or modification.
- If Java allowed pointer manipulation, it would enable external code to directly access and modify an object's memory, which could violate the principles of OOP.

### 7. **Use of References Instead of Pointers**:
- Java uses **references** instead of pointers. While references may look similar to pointers, they are safer. A reference points to an object in memory, but it does not expose the actual memory address.
- For example, when you create an object, you use a reference to point to that object, but you can't directly manipulate the memory address of the reference itself. This makes working with objects easier and safer than working with raw pointers.

### Example:
```java
public class Person {
    String name;

    public Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person p1 = new Person("Alice");
        Person p2 = p1;  // p2 references the same object as p1, no direct memory manipulation

        System.out.println(p1.name);  // Alice
        System.out.println(p2.name);  // Alice
    }
}
```
In this example, `p1` and `p2` are references to the same `Person` object, but Java doesn't expose the memory addresses directly, which eliminates pointer-related issues.

### Summary:
Java does not support pointers because:
- It prioritizes **safety** by preventing direct memory access.
- It uses **automatic memory management** (garbage collection) instead of manual memory allocation.
- It focuses on **abstraction** and **portability**, ensuring Java programs are safer, easier to maintain, and platform-independent.
- It uses **references** as a safer alternative to pointers, reducing the risk of memory errors and improving code readability.

<hr style="border:1px solid orange">

### What is super in Java?

In Java, the `super` keyword is used to refer to the **parent class** (also called the superclass) from within a subclass. It serves several important purposes:

### Key Uses of `super`:

1. **Accessing Parent Class Constructors**:
   - The `super()` keyword is used to call the constructor of the parent class. It must be the **first statement** in the constructor of the subclass.
   - If no constructor is explicitly defined in the subclass, Java automatically calls the **no-argument constructor** of the parent class.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   class Animal {
       Animal() {
           System.out.println("Animal constructor");
       }
   }

   class Dog extends Animal {
       Dog() {
           super();  // Calls the parent class constructor
           System.out.println("Dog constructor");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Dog d = new Dog();  // Output: Animal constructor \n Dog constructor
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Accessing Parent Class Methods**:
   - The `super` keyword can be used to call a method from the parent class. This is helpful if the subclass has overridden a method and you want to invoke the parent class version of the method.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   class Animal {
       void sound() {
           System.out.println("Animal sound");
       }
   }

   class Dog extends Animal {
       void sound() {
           super.sound();  // Calls the parent class method
           System.out.println("Bark");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Dog d = new Dog();
           d.sound();  // Output: Animal sound \n Bark
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Accessing Parent Class Fields**:
   - If a subclass has a field with the same name as a field in the parent class, you can use `super` to refer to the parent class field and avoid ambiguity.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   class Animal {
       String name = "Animal";
   }

   class Dog extends Animal {
       String name = "Dog";

       void printName() {
           System.out.println("Subclass name: " + name);  // Refers to Dog's 'name'
           System.out.println("Parent class name: " + super.name);  // Refers to Animal's 'name'
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Dog d = new Dog();
           d.printName();  // Output: Subclass name: Dog \n Parent class name: Animal
       }
   }
   ```

### Summary of Uses:
- **Calling Parent Class Constructors**: `super()` is used to call the constructor of the parent class.
- **Calling Parent Class Methods**: `super.method()` is used to invoke a method from the parent class, especially if the subclass has overridden it.
- **Accessing Parent Class Fields**: `super.field` is used to access a field from the parent class, particularly if the subclass has a field with the same name.

### Example of All Uses Together:
```java
class Animal {
    String name;

    Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    Dog(String name) {
        super(name);  // Calling the constructor of the parent class
    }

    void sound() {
        super.sound();  // Calling the parent class method
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }

    void printName() {
        System.out.println("Name from parent class: " + super.name);  // Accessing the parent class field
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog("Buddy");
        d.sound();  // Output: Animal sound \n Bark
        d.printName();  // Output: Name from parent class: Buddy
    }
}
```

### Summary:
- **`super`** refers to the parent class.
- It is used to:
   - Call the parent class constructor (`super()`).
   - Access overridden methods of the parent class (`super.method()`).
   - Access fields of the parent class (`super.field`).

### What is **Method Overloading** and **Method Overriding** in Java?

#### **1. Method Overloading:**
Method Overloading occurs when **multiple methods** in the **same class** have the **same name** but **different parameters** (number or type of parameters). It allows methods to perform similar operations with different types or numbers of arguments.

**Key Points**:
- Happens **within the same class**.
- Methods must have the **same name** but **different parameter lists** (either in the number, type, or order of parameters).
- It is an example of **compile-time polymorphism** (also known as static binding).
- Return type can be the same or different, but it alone does not differentiate overloaded methods.

**Example**:
```java
class Calculator {
    // Method to add two integers
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    // Overloaded method to add three integers
    int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }

    // Overloaded method to add two doubles
    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        System.out.println(calc.add(2, 3));          // Calls add(int, int)
        System.out.println(calc.add(2, 3, 4));      // Calls add(int, int, int)
        System.out.println(calc.add(2.5, 3.5));     // Calls add(double, double)
    }
}
```

**Output**:
```

#### **2. Method Overriding:**
Method Overriding occurs when a **subclass** provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its **parent class**. The overridden method in the subclass must have the **same name, return type, and parameters** as the method in the parent class.

**Key Points**:
- Happens **between parent and child classes**.
- The method in the subclass must have the **same signature** (name, return type, and parameters) as in the parent class.
- It is an example of **runtime polymorphism** (also known as dynamic binding).
- The method in the subclass is called instead of the method in the parent class when invoked on a subclass object.
- The `@Override` annotation can be used for better readability and to ensure correctness.
- **Access modifiers**: The overriding method **cannot reduce visibility** (e.g., a `public` method in the parent class cannot be overridden with `protected` in the subclass).

**Example**:
```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Animal();
        a.sound();  // Output: Animal makes a sound

        Animal d = new Dog();
        d.sound();  // Output: Dog barks
    }
}
```

### **Comparison of Method Overloading vs Method Overriding**

| **Feature**               | **Method Overloading**                                  | **Method Overriding**                             |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Where it happens**      | In the **same class**                                   | Between a **parent and child class**             |
| **Polymorphism type**     | Compile-time polymorphism (static binding)              | Runtime polymorphism (dynamic binding)           |
| **Method signature**      | Methods must have the **same name**, but **different parameter lists** | Methods must have the **same name and parameters** |
| **Return type**           | Can be the same or different                           | Must be the same or a covariant return type      |
| **Annotation**            | Not required                                           | `@Override` is recommended for readability      |
| **Access modifiers**      | No restrictions                                        | Cannot reduce the visibility of the parent method |
| **Use case**              | To perform similar tasks with different inputs         | To provide a specific implementation in a subclass |

---

### Summary:
- **Method Overloading**: Same class, same method name, different parameter lists, resolved at compile time.
- **Method Overriding**: Parent-child class relationship, same method signature, resolved at runtime.

### What is the final Variable in Java?

In Java, the `final` keyword is used to declare constants. A **final variable** is a variable whose value, once assigned, cannot be changed. It makes the variable **immutable**.

---

### Key Points About `final` Variable:
1. **Initialization**:
   - A `final` variable must be initialized **only once**.
   - You can assign its value either:
      - At the time of declaration, or
      - In the **constructor** if it is a non-static `final` variable.
   - For **static final variables**, the value must be assigned when declared or in a static block.

2. **Immutable**:
   - Once a `final` variable is assigned a value, you cannot reassign it.

3. **Constants**:
   - `final` variables are commonly used to define constants (values that do not change) by combining `static` and `final` keywords.

4. **Reference Variables**:
   - For `final` reference variables (like objects), the reference itself cannot change, but the object's internal state can be modified (if it is mutable).

---

### Examples of `final` Variable:

#### Example 1: Final Variable with Direct Initialization
```java
public class Main {
    final int speedLimit = 120;  // Value is directly assigned

    void display() {
        // speedLimit = 150;  // Compilation error: cannot reassign a final variable
        System.out.println("Speed Limit: " + speedLimit);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main obj = new Main();
        obj.display();  // Output: Speed Limit: 120
    }
}
```

---

#### Example 2: Final Variable Initialized in Constructor
```java
public class Main {
    final int speedLimit;

    Main(int limit) {
        speedLimit = limit;  // Value assigned in the constructor
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main obj = new Main(100);
        System.out.println("Speed Limit: " + obj.speedLimit);  // Output: Speed Limit: 100
    }
}
```

---

#### Example 3: Final Static Variable (Constant)
```java
public class Main {
    static final double PI = 3.14159;  // Static final variable (constant)

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Value of PI: " + PI);  // Output: Value of PI: 3.14159
    }
}
```

---

#### Example 4: Final Reference Variable
```java
class Person {
    String name;

    Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final Person person = new Person("Alice");
        System.out.println(person.name);  // Output: Alice

        // person = new Person("Bob");  // Compilation error: cannot reassign final reference

        person.name = "Bob";  // Allowed: Modifying the object's state
        System.out.println(person.name);  // Output: Bob
    }
}
```

---

### Key Points to Remember:
1. **Primitive Final Variables**:
   - Their value cannot be changed once assigned.

2. **Final Reference Variables**:
   - The reference itself cannot change, but the object it refers to can be modified (if it is mutable).

3. **Usage in Constants**:
   - Combine `static` and `final` for defining constants, e.g., `static final int MAX = 100;`.

4. **Compilation Errors**:
   - Trying to reassign a final variable results in a **compilation error**.

---

### Summary:
- The `final` variable in Java ensures that a variable can be initialized only **once**.
- It is often used to define **constants** or enforce immutability in your code.
- For primitive types, the value cannot change; for reference types, the reference cannot change but the object's internal state can.

### **Difference Between Compile-Time Polymorphism and Runtime Polymorphism in Java**

Polymorphism in Java refers to the ability of an object to take many forms. It is categorized into **compile-time polymorphism** and **runtime polymorphism**, based on when the method binding is resolved.

---

### **1. Compile-Time Polymorphism**
**Definition**:
Compile-time polymorphism, also known as **static binding** or **early binding**, occurs when the method to be called is resolved at **compile time**.

**Achieved Through**:
- **Method Overloading**: When multiple methods in a class have the same name but different parameter lists.

**Key Features**:
1. **Binding**: Resolved at **compile time**.
2. **Faster Execution**: As the method call is resolved during compilation, it is faster.
3. **No Inheritance Required**: It does not require parent-child relationships.
4. **Example**: Achieved by method overloading.

**Example**:
```java
class Calculator {
    // Overloaded methods
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        System.out.println(calc.add(2, 3));      // Calls add(int, int)
        System.out.println(calc.add(2, 3, 4));  // Calls add(int, int, int)
    }
}
```

**Output**:
```
5
9
```

---

### **2. Runtime Polymorphism**
**Definition**:
Runtime polymorphism, also known as **dynamic binding** or **late binding**, occurs when the method to be called is resolved at **runtime**.

**Achieved Through**:
- **Method Overriding**: When a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class.

**Key Features**:
1. **Binding**: Resolved at **runtime**.
2. **Slower Execution**: As the method call is resolved during runtime, it is slightly slower.
3. **Inheritance Required**: It requires parent-child relationships and method overriding.
4. **Example**: Achieved by method overriding.

**Example**:
```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a;  // Reference of parent class

        a = new Animal();
        a.sound();  // Calls Animal's sound()

        a = new Dog();
        a.sound();  // Calls Dog's sound() (runtime polymorphism)
    }
}
```

**Output**:
```
Animal makes a sound
Dog barks
```

---

### **Key Differences**

| **Feature**                 | **Compile-Time Polymorphism**               | **Runtime Polymorphism**                 |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Also Known As**           | Static binding / Early binding             | Dynamic binding / Late binding          |
| **When Resolved**           | During **compile time**                    | During **runtime**                      |
| **How Achieved**            | By **method overloading**                  | By **method overriding**                |
| **Inheritance Required**    | **Not required**                           | **Required** (parent-child relationship) |
| **Execution Speed**         | **Faster** (resolved at compile time)      | **Slightly slower** (resolved at runtime)|
| **Flexibility**             | Less flexible (fixed at compile time)      | More flexible (decision made at runtime)|
| **Example**                 | Multiple methods with same name but different parameters. | Subclass provides specific implementation of a method. |

---

### **Summary**:
1. **Compile-Time Polymorphism**: Happens at compile time, achieved via method overloading, faster but less flexible.
2. **Runtime Polymorphism**: Happens at runtime, achieved via method overriding, slower but more dynamic and flexible.

Both types of polymorphism are essential in Java to make the code more reusable, maintainable, and dynamic.

### What is the instanceof Operator in Java?

The `instanceof` operator in Java is used to **test whether an object is an instance of a specific class or subclass** or **implements a particular interface**. It returns a boolean value (`true` or `false`).

---

### **Syntax**
```java
object instanceof ClassName
```

- **object**: The reference variable to be tested.
- **ClassName**: The class, subclass, or interface you want to check against.
- Returns **`true`** if the object is an instance of the given class or subclass or implements the interface; otherwise, it returns **`false`**.

---

### **Key Points**
1. The `instanceof` operator is used for **type checking**.
2. It is a **compile-time and runtime operator**:
   - The check happens at runtime, but the compiler ensures the compatibility of the types being checked.
3. If the object reference is `null`, the `instanceof` operator always returns **`false`**.
4. It works with **classes, subclasses, and interfaces**.

---

### **Examples**

#### **Example 1: Basic Usage**
```java
class Animal {}

class Dog extends Animal {}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Animal();
        Dog d = new Dog();

        System.out.println(a instanceof Animal);  // Output: true
        System.out.println(d instanceof Animal);  // Output: true (Dog is a subclass of Animal)
        System.out.println(a instanceof Dog);     // Output: false
    }
}
```

---

#### **Example 2: Checking Against an Interface**
```java
interface Vehicle {}

class Car implements Vehicle {}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car();

        System.out.println(myCar instanceof Vehicle);  // Output: true (Car implements Vehicle)
        System.out.println(myCar instanceof Object);   // Output: true (All classes inherit from Object)
    }
}
```

---

#### **Example 3: Null Check**
```java
class Animal {}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = null;

        System.out.println(a instanceof Animal);  // Output: false (null is not an instance of any class)
    }
}
```

---

### **When to Use `instanceof`**
1. **Type Checking Before Casting**:
   - To avoid `ClassCastException`, you can check the type of an object before casting it.
   ```java
   class Animal {}
   class Dog extends Animal {}

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Animal a = new Dog();

           if (a instanceof Dog) {
               Dog d = (Dog) a;  // Safe casting
               System.out.println("Casting successful!");
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Handling Objects Dynamically**:
   - When dealing with polymorphism or collections of objects, `instanceof` helps identify the actual type of an object.

---

### **Advantages**
- Prevents runtime errors like `ClassCastException`.
- Helps in implementing dynamic behavior in polymorphic code.

---

### **Disadvantages**
- Overuse of `instanceof` may indicate poor design, such as not fully utilizing polymorphism.
- Instead of relying heavily on `instanceof`, consider using method overriding for dynamic behavior.

---

### **Summary**
The `instanceof` operator:
- Tests whether an object is of a specific type (class, subclass, or interface).
- Returns `true` or `false` based on the type match.
- Useful for type checking and safe casting in polymorphic scenarios.

### **Differences Between Abstract Class and Interface in Java**

In Java, both **abstract classes** and **interfaces** are used to achieve abstraction, but they differ in their implementation and usage. Below is a detailed comparison:

---

### **1. Definition**
- **Abstract Class**: A class that cannot be instantiated and may contain a mix of concrete methods (with implementation) and abstract methods (without implementation).
- **Interface**: A blueprint that defines a contract that classes must follow. It contains only abstract methods (prior to Java 8) or abstract and default/static methods (in Java 8 and later).

---

### **2. Syntax**

- **Abstract Class**:
  ```java
  abstract class ClassName {
      abstract void methodName();  // Abstract method
      void concreteMethod() {
          // Implementation
      }
  }
  ```

- **Interface**:
  ```java
  interface InterfaceName {
      void methodName();  // Abstract method (implicitly public and abstract)
  }
  ```

---

### **3. Key Differences**

| **Feature**                  | **Abstract Class**                                        | **Interface**                                              |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Nature**                   | Can have both **abstract** and **concrete** methods.     | Contains only **abstract methods** (before Java 8). From Java 8, can have **default** and **static** methods. |
| **Inheritance**              | A class can **extend only one abstract class**.          | A class can **implement multiple interfaces**.            |
| **Modifiers for Methods**    | Methods can have any access modifier (e.g., `public`, `protected`, `private`). | Methods are implicitly **public abstract** (before Java 8). Default and static methods can also be included (from Java 8). |
| **Constructors**             | Can have constructors to initialize fields.              | Cannot have constructors.                                 |
| **Fields (Variables)**       | Can have instance variables (with or without `final`).   | Can have only **public static final** (constants).        |
| **Use Case**                 | Used when classes share a common base class or behavior. | Used to define a contract that multiple classes can implement. |
| **Speed**                    | Faster as it is closer to normal classes.                | Slightly slower due to the need for additional indirection.|
| **Multiple Inheritance**     | Not supported (a class can extend only one abstract class). | Supported (a class can implement multiple interfaces).    |

---

### **4. Examples**

#### **Abstract Class Example**
```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void sound();  // Abstract method

    void eat() {  // Concrete method
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.sound();  // Output: Dog barks
        myDog.eat();    // Output: This animal eats food.
    }
}
```

---

#### **Interface Example**
```java
interface Animal {
    void sound();  // Abstract method
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.sound();  // Output: Dog barks
    }
}
```

---

#### **Interface with Default and Static Methods (Java 8)**
```java
interface Animal {
    void sound();

    default void sleep() {
        System.out.println("This animal sleeps");
    }

    static void info() {
        System.out.println("Animals are part of nature");
    }
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.sound();   // Output: Dog barks
        myDog.sleep();   // Output: This animal sleeps

        Animal.info();   // Output: Animals are part of nature
    }
}
```

---

### **5. When to Use**
- **Abstract Class**:
   - Use when classes share common state or behavior.
   - When you need to define non-static or non-final variables.

- **Interface**:
   - Use when unrelated classes need to share a contract (e.g., `Runnable`, `Comparable`).
   - When you want to achieve multiple inheritance.

---

### **Summary**

| **Feature**       | **Abstract Class**                          | **Interface**                                  |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Methods**       | Both abstract and concrete methods allowed.| Only abstract (pre-Java 8) or default/static methods (post-Java 8). |
| **Variables**     | Instance variables allowed.                | Only `public static final` (constants).       |
| **Inheritance**   | Single inheritance.                       | Multiple inheritance.                        |
| **Constructor**   | Allowed.                                   | Not allowed.                                 |

- **Use Abstract Class**: When you need shared behavior and state.
- **Use Interface**: When you want a class to implement multiple contracts.

### **Types of Exceptions in Java**

In Java, exceptions are classified into two main categories based on when they are checked: **Checked Exceptions** and **Unchecked Exceptions**. Additionally, Java provides a category for **Errors** that represent serious issues outside the application's control.

---

### **1. Checked Exceptions**
- **Definition**: Exceptions that are checked at **compile-time**.
- The Java compiler ensures that these exceptions are handled properly using a `try-catch` block or declared with the `throws` keyword.
- These exceptions are usually caused by external factors, such as file I/O, network issues, or database access.

**Examples**:
- `IOException`
- `SQLException`
- `FileNotFoundException`
- `ClassNotFoundException`

**Example Code**:
```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            FileReader reader = new FileReader("file.txt");  // File might not exist
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("File not found: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

---

### **2. Unchecked Exceptions**
- **Definition**: Exceptions that are not checked at **compile-time**.
- These exceptions occur due to programming mistakes and are usually related to logical errors in the code.
- They are subclasses of `RuntimeException` and can occur at runtime without prior notice.

**Examples**:
- `ArithmeticException`
- `NullPointerException`
- `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`
- `NumberFormatException`

**Example Code**:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 10 / 0;  // ArithmeticException: Division by zero
    }
}
```

---

### **3. Errors**
- **Definition**: Serious issues that are not meant to be caught or handled in the program.
- Errors represent problems related to the **JVM** or system resources, and they usually result in the termination of the application.
- Errors are subclasses of the `Error` class.

**Examples**:
- `StackOverflowError` (caused by infinite recursion)
- `OutOfMemoryError` (caused by insufficient memory allocation)
- `VirtualMachineError`

**Example Code**:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        main(args);  // Causes StackOverflowError due to infinite recursion
    }
}
```

---

### **Summary Table**

| **Type**                | **Description**                                                                                  | **Examples**                      | **When Checked**      |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Checked Exceptions**  | Handled at compile-time; caused by external factors like I/O or database access.                | `IOException`, `SQLException`    | Compile-time          |
| **Unchecked Exceptions**| Handled at runtime; caused by programming mistakes or logical errors.                           | `NullPointerException`, `ArithmeticException` | Runtime           |
| **Errors**              | Serious issues related to the JVM or system that are typically not recoverable.                 | `StackOverflowError`, `OutOfMemoryError` | Runtime           |

---

### **Key Points**
1. Checked exceptions must be explicitly handled or declared.
2. Unchecked exceptions can be avoided with proper coding practices.
3. Errors are beyond the application's control and cannot be reasonably handled.

By understanding these categories, you can write robust Java programs that handle exceptions effectively.

### **Difference Between throw and throws in Java**

The keywords `throw` and `throws` in Java are both related to exception handling, but they serve different purposes. Here's a detailed comparison:

---

### **1. `throw`**
- **Purpose**: Used to **explicitly throw an exception** in the code.
- **Usage**: Within a method or block, followed by an instance of `Throwable` (e.g., `Exception` or `Error`).
- **Control Flow**: Once an exception is thrown, the program execution jumps to the nearest matching `catch` block or terminates if not caught.
- **Scope**: It is used **inside the method**.

#### **Syntax**:
```java
throw new ExceptionType("Exception Message");
```

#### **Example**:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void validateAge(int age) {
        if (age < 18) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age must be 18 or older.");
        }
        System.out.println("Age is valid.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        validateAge(15);  // Throws IllegalArgumentException
    }
}
```

---

### **2. `throws`**
- **Purpose**: Declares that a method can **throw exceptions** of the specified types, signaling the caller to handle them.
- **Usage**: In the **method signature**, followed by a list of exception types separated by commas.
- **Control Flow**: It does not throw the exception itself but informs the caller that the method may throw exceptions.
- **Scope**: Used in the **method declaration**.

#### **Syntax**:
```java
returnType methodName() throws ExceptionType1, ExceptionType2 {
    // Method logic
}
```

#### **Example**:
```java
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
    public static void readFile(String fileName) throws IOException {
        if (fileName == null) {
            throw new IOException("File name cannot be null.");
        }
        System.out.println("File read successfully.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            readFile(null);  // Throws IOException
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught Exception: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

---

### **Key Differences**

| **Feature**         | **`throw`**                                  | **`throws`**                                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**         | Used to **explicitly throw** an exception.   | Used to **declare exceptions** a method may throw. |
| **Position**        | Used **inside the method body**.             | Used in the **method signature**.            |
| **Number of Exceptions** | Can throw only **one exception** at a time. | Can declare **multiple exceptions** separated by commas. |
| **Execution**       | Transfers control to the nearest `catch` block or terminates. | Warns the caller to handle exceptions.      |
| **Example**         | `throw new IOException("Error occurred");`   | `void method() throws IOException { }`      |

---

### **Combined Example**
```java
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
    public static void readFile(String fileName) throws IOException {
        if (fileName == null) {
            throw new IOException("File name cannot be null.");  // Using throw
        }
        System.out.println("File read successfully.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            readFile(null);  // Method declares `throws IOException`
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught Exception: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

---

### **Summary**
| **Aspect**           | **`throw`**                              | **`throws`**                              |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Action**           | Throws an exception at runtime.         | Declares the possibility of exceptions.  |
| **Used Where**       | Inside the method body.                 | In the method signature.                |
| **Number**           | Throws one exception at a time.         | Declares multiple exceptions.           |
| **Purpose**          | To throw a specific exception.          | To notify the caller of potential exceptions. |

By understanding `throw` and `throws`, you can effectively handle exceptions in Java and write more robust code.

### **Why Are Objects Immutable in Java?**

In Java, **immutable objects** are objects whose state cannot be changed once they are created. Immutable objects are designed to provide several benefits related to safety, performance, and simplicity. Below, we explain why immutability is important in Java:

---

### **Reasons for Immutability in Java**

1. **Thread Safety**
   - Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe because their state cannot be modified after creation.
   - Multiple threads can access the same immutable object simultaneously without synchronization, reducing complexity in multi-threaded environments.

   **Example**:
   Strings in Java are immutable, so they are safe to use across multiple threads without the need for explicit locking.

   ```java
   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           String str = "Hello";
           String upperStr = str.toUpperCase();  // Creates a new String object
           System.out.println(str);  // Original string remains unchanged
       }
   }
   ```

---

2. **Caching and Reusability**
   - Since the state of an immutable object cannot change, the same object can be safely shared or cached.
   - For example, the `String` pool in Java allows reusing string objects to save memory and improve performance.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   String s1 = "Hello";
   String s2 = "Hello";  // Points to the same object in the string pool
   System.out.println(s1 == s2);  // Output: true
   ```

---

3. **Simplified Debugging**
   - Immutable objects are easier to debug because their state does not change unexpectedly during the program's execution.
   - They eliminate bugs caused by unintended state changes, making code more predictable and reliable.

---

4. **Security**
   - Immutable objects provide a higher level of security since their internal state cannot be altered. This is especially useful when dealing with sensitive data.
   - For instance, immutable objects can safely be used in collections or passed to untrusted code without the risk of data modification.

---

5. **Integrity in Collections**
   - Immutable objects are often used as keys in hash-based collections like `HashMap` or `HashSet`.
   - If the state of a key object changes, it can break the hashing mechanism. Immutable objects ensure the integrity of such collections.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   import java.util.HashMap;

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           HashMap<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();
           map.put("key1", "value1");

           // If "key1" were mutable, its hashCode could change, causing lookup issues
           System.out.println(map.get("key1"));  // Output: value1
       }
   }
   ```

---

6. **Prevention of Side Effects**
   - Immutability ensures that an object's state cannot be accidentally or maliciously altered by other parts of the program.
   - This makes the behavior of immutable objects more predictable.

---

### **How Does Java Enforce Immutability?**

1. **Declaring Fields as `final`**
   - `final` ensures that the reference cannot be changed after initialization.
   ```java
   public class ImmutableExample {
       private final String name;

       public ImmutableExample(String name) {
           this.name = name;
       }

       public String getName() {
           return name;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Private Fields**
   - Fields are declared `private` to prevent direct access or modification from outside the class.

3. **No Setter Methods**
   - Immutable classes do not provide setter methods to modify fields after the object is created.

4. **Defensive Copying**
   - If a field is mutable (e.g., an array or list), a defensive copy is made when accessing or modifying it.
   ```java
   public class ImmutableExample {
       private final int[] numbers;

       public ImmutableExample(int[] numbers) {
           this.numbers = numbers.clone();  // Defensive copy
       }

       public int[] getNumbers() {
           return numbers.clone();  // Return a copy, not the original
       }
   }
   ```

---

### **Examples of Immutable Classes in Java**
1. **`String`**:
   - Strings in Java are immutable to support features like the string pool and prevent unexpected behavior.
2. **`Wrapper Classes`**:
   - Classes like `Integer`, `Double`, `Boolean`, etc., are immutable.

---

### **Conclusion**
Objects are immutable in Java to:
- Ensure thread safety.
- Improve security and integrity.
- Enhance caching and reusability.
- Simplify debugging and maintenance.
- Prevent side effects and maintain consistency in collections.

By following immutability principles, you can create reliable and maintainable Java programs.

### **Differences Between String and StringBuffer in Java**

`String` and `StringBuffer` are two classes in Java used to work with strings. However, they have significant differences in terms of **immutability**, **performance**, and **use cases**.

---

### **1. Mutability**

- **`String`**: Immutable
  Once a `String` object is created, its value cannot be changed. Any modification (e.g., concatenation) results in the creation of a new `String` object.

  **Example**:
  ```java
  public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          String str = "Hello";
          str = str + " World";  // Creates a new String object
          System.out.println(str);  // Output: Hello World
      }
  }
  ```

- **`StringBuffer`**: Mutable
  The value of a `StringBuffer` object can be modified without creating a new object, making it more efficient for string manipulation.

  **Example**:
  ```java
  public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Hello");
          sb.append(" World");  // Modifies the same object
          System.out.println(sb);  // Output: Hello World
      }
  }
  ```

---

### **2. Performance**

- **`String`**:
   - Less efficient for frequent modifications (e.g., concatenation, insertion, or deletion) because each operation creates a new object and copies the existing string.

- **`StringBuffer`**:
   - More efficient for frequent modifications because it directly modifies the internal buffer instead of creating new objects.

---

### **3. Thread-Safety**

- **`String`**:
   - **Thread-safe** because it is immutable. Multiple threads can safely access the same `String` object without additional synchronization.

- **`StringBuffer`**:
   - **Thread-safe** because its methods are synchronized, ensuring only one thread can modify the `StringBuffer` at a time.

---

### **4. Synchronization**

- **`String`**: No synchronization is needed as it is immutable.
- **`StringBuffer`**: Uses synchronized methods to make it thread-safe, which can introduce a slight performance overhead in single-threaded environments.

---

### **5. Use Cases**

- **`String`**:
  Use `String` when:
   - The value does not change frequently.
   - Immutability is required (e.g., when working with string literals or as keys in a `HashMap`).

- **`StringBuffer`**:
  Use `StringBuffer` when:
   - You need to modify the string frequently.
   - Thread safety is required in a multi-threaded environment.

---

### **6. Memory Usage**

- **`String`**: Creates a new object every time it is modified, leading to higher memory usage.
- **`StringBuffer`**: Reuses the same object, leading to lower memory usage for frequent modifications.

---

### **7. Methods**

| **Feature**            | **`String`**               | **`StringBuffer`**            |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Concatenation**       | `concat()`, `+` operator  | `append()`                    |
| **Substring**           | `substring()`             | No direct method; use `delete()` and `insert()` for similar effects. |
| **Length**              | `length()`                | `length()`                    |
| **Reverse String**      | Not supported             | `reverse()`                   |

---

### **Examples**

#### **String Example**
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "Java";
        str = str + " Programming";  // Creates a new object
        System.out.println(str);  // Output: Java Programming
    }
}
```

#### **StringBuffer Example**
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Java");
        sb.append(" Programming");  // Modifies the same object
        System.out.println(sb);  // Output: Java Programming
    }
}
```

---

### **Comparison Table**

| **Aspect**         | **`String`**                        | **`StringBuffer`**                 |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Mutability**      | Immutable                           | Mutable                            |
| **Performance**     | Slower for frequent modifications   | Faster for frequent modifications  |
| **Thread-Safety**   | Thread-safe (immutable by nature)   | Thread-safe (synchronized methods) |
| **Use Case**        | When immutability is required       | When frequent modifications are needed in multi-threaded environments |
| **Memory Usage**    | Higher (due to object creation)     | Lower (reuses the same object)     |

---

### **Conclusion**

- Use **`String`** for immutable and constant string values.
- Use **`StringBuffer`** when you need mutable strings and thread safety in multi-threaded environments.
  For single-threaded environments, you may consider using **`StringBuilder`**, which is similar to `StringBuffer` but faster because it is not synchronized.

### **Differences Between StringBuffer and StringBuilder in Java**

`StringBuffer` and `StringBuilder` are both used to create mutable strings in Java, meaning their content can be modified after creation. However, they differ primarily in terms of **thread safety** and **performance**.

---

### **Key Differences**

| **Aspect**         | **`StringBuffer`**                        | **`StringBuilder`**                   |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Thread Safety**   | Thread-safe: All methods are synchronized. | Not thread-safe: Methods are not synchronized. |
| **Performance**     | Slower due to synchronization overhead.   | Faster because it does not have synchronization overhead. |
| **Use Case**        | Suitable for multi-threaded environments. | Suitable for single-threaded environments. |
| **Synchronization** | Methods are synchronized, ensuring only one thread can access them at a time. | No synchronization, so multiple threads can access it simultaneously, potentially causing issues. |
| **Introduced In**   | Java 1.0                                  | Java 1.5 (to improve performance in single-threaded cases). |

---

### **Similarities**
1. **Mutability**:
   - Both `StringBuffer` and `StringBuilder` allow modification of the string's content without creating a new object.

2. **Methods**:
   - Both provide similar methods such as `append()`, `insert()`, `delete()`, `replace()`, `reverse()`, `capacity()`, and `length()`.

3. **Efficient for Modifications**:
   - Both are more efficient than `String` when performing multiple modifications (e.g., concatenation or insertion).

---

### **Examples**

#### **Using `StringBuffer`**
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Hello");
        sb.append(" World");
        System.out.println(sb);  // Output: Hello World
    }
}
```

#### **Using `StringBuilder`**
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
        sb.append(" World");
        System.out.println(sb);  // Output: Hello World
    }
}
```

---

### **Performance Example**
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        long startTime, endTime;

        // StringBuffer Performance
        StringBuffer stringBuffer = new StringBuffer("Java");
        startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
            stringBuffer.append(" Programming");
        }
        endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        System.out.println("StringBuffer Time: " + (endTime - startTime) + " ms");

        // StringBuilder Performance
        StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder("Java");
        startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
            stringBuilder.append(" Programming");
        }
        endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        System.out.println("StringBuilder Time: " + (endTime - startTime) + " ms");
    }
}
```
---

### **When to Use**
1. **`StringBuffer`**:
   - Use when you are working in a **multi-threaded** environment and need to ensure thread safety.

2. **`StringBuilder`**:
   - Use when you are working in a **single-threaded** environment, or thread safety is not a concern, as it provides better performance.

---

---

### **Conclusion**

- Use **`StringBuffer`** when **thread safety** is required.
- Use **`StringBuilder`** when **performance** is more critical, and thread safety is not an issue.

### **What is Garbage Collection in Java?**

**Garbage Collection (GC)** in Java is the process of automatically identifying and removing objects that are no longer in use by the program, in order to reclaim memory. It helps in managing memory efficiently, so developers don't need to explicitly release memory resources for objects that are no longer needed.

---

### **How Garbage Collection Works in Java**

- **Automatic Memory Management**:
  Java automatically manages memory using the **Heap**, which is where all objects are stored. When objects are no longer reachable (i.e., no live thread or reference is holding a reference to them), they become eligible for garbage collection.

- **GC Algorithm**:
  Java uses **different garbage collection algorithms** to clean up the heap. The JVM decides when and how to perform garbage collection.

---

### **Key Concepts**

1. **Heap**:
   - The heap is the part of memory where Java stores objects at runtime. It is divided into generations:
      - **Young Generation**: Where new objects are created.
      - **Old Generation**: Where long-lived objects are promoted after surviving several garbage collection cycles.
      - **Permanent Generation (Method Area)**: Stores metadata, class definitions, and method information (replaced by Metaspace in Java 8).

2. **Garbage Collector**:
   - The Garbage Collector is a part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) that automatically handles memory management by removing objects that are no longer referenced.

3. **Reachability**:
   - An object is considered **reachable** if it can be accessed through any chain of references from active threads or static fields.
   - When no reachable references remain, the object becomes **unreachable** and eligible for garbage collection.

4. **Finalization**:
   - Before garbage collection, the **`finalize()`** method (if overridden by the class) is called. This method allows you to release resources like closing file handles or network connections.

---

### **Types of Garbage Collection in Java**

1. **Minor GC (Young Generation GC)**:
   - Occurs in the **Young Generation**, where most objects are created.
   - It is typically quick because only a small portion of the heap is cleaned up.
   - It uses algorithms like **Mark and Sweep** or **Copying** to reclaim memory.

2. **Major GC (Full GC or Old Generation GC)**:
   - Occurs when objects in the **Old Generation** need to be cleaned up.
   - This is slower because it involves scanning the entire heap (including both the Young and Old generations).

3. **Garbage Collector Types**:
   - **Serial GC**: Uses a single thread for garbage collection. Suitable for single-threaded applications.
   - **Parallel GC**: Uses multiple threads for garbage collection to improve performance.
   - **CMS (Concurrent Mark Sweep)**: Aims to minimize application pause times by performing most of the work concurrently with application threads.
   - **G1 GC (Garbage First)**: Aims for predictable pause times by breaking the heap into regions and collecting garbage in phases.

---

### **When Does Garbage Collection Happen?**

- **JVM decides**: Garbage collection is managed by the JVM, and the developer does not need to explicitly invoke it.
- It occurs when:
   - The **heap memory is low**.
   - The **young generation** fills up.
   - The **Old Generation** is full, and objects need to be cleaned.

---

### **Benefits of Garbage Collection**

1. **Automatic Memory Management**:
   Developers don't need to manually deallocate memory, which reduces errors related to memory leaks or forgetting to release memory.

2. **Efficient Resource Management**:
   Garbage collection helps manage memory more efficiently, improving performance in long-running applications.

3. **Prevention of Memory Leaks**:
   Objects that are no longer referenced are automatically removed from memory, reducing the chances of memory leaks (although programmers should still avoid creating unnecessary references).

---

### **Limitations of Garbage Collection**

1. **Unpredictable Timing**:
   The exact timing of garbage collection is not predictable, and it may introduce **pause times** during execution, which may affect performance, especially in real-time applications.

2. **Performance Overhead**:
   While GC helps in memory management, it also introduces overhead due to the need to track and clean up unused objects.

3. **Cannot Remove All Objects**:
   Garbage collection only handles unreachable objects. It does not handle objects that are still referenced, even if they are no longer used.

---

### **Manual Garbage Collection (Not Recommended)**

While garbage collection is automatic in Java, it is possible to manually request garbage collection using the **`System.gc()`** method. However, calling this method is discouraged because:
- It is not guaranteed to trigger GC.
- It introduces unnecessary overhead and can affect performance.
- The JVM itself determines the optimal time to collect garbage.

---

### **Example: Automatic Garbage Collection**

```java
public class GCExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating objects
        GCExample obj1 = new GCExample();
        GCExample obj2 = new GCExample();

        // Assigning null to obj1, making it eligible for garbage collection
        obj1 = null;

        // Requesting garbage collection (not recommended)
        System.gc();

        // obj2 still exists and can be accessed
        System.out.println("obj2 is still available.");
    }

    // Overriding finalize method (not commonly used)
    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        System.out.println("Object is being garbage collected.");
    }
}
```

In this example, when `obj1` is set to `null`, it becomes eligible for garbage collection because no other references are holding onto it. The `finalize()` method (if overridden) is invoked before the object is removed from memory.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **Garbage Collection** in Java is an automatic process that frees up memory by removing objects that are no longer in use.
- It helps in **memory management**, prevents memory leaks, and improves the overall performance of the application.
- The exact timing of garbage collection is handled by the JVM and cannot be explicitly controlled by the developer, but understanding how it works helps in optimizing application performance.

### **Differences Between final, finally, and finalize in Java**

These three terms in Java — **`final`**, **`finally`**, and **`finalize`** — have different meanings and uses. Let's break them down:

---

### **1. `final`**

**Usage**:
The `final` keyword is used to define constants, prevent method overriding, and prevent inheritance.

#### **Different Uses of `final`:**

- **Final Variable**:
  A `final` variable cannot be reassigned once it has been initialized. It is often used to declare constants.

  **Example**:
  ```java
  final int MAX_VALUE = 100;
  // MAX_VALUE = 200; // Error: cannot assign a value to final variable
  ```

- **Final Method**:
  A `final` method cannot be overridden by subclasses.

  **Example**:
  ```java
  class Parent {
      public final void show() {
          System.out.println("This is a final method.");
      }
  }

  class Child extends Parent {
      // public void show() {}  // Error: cannot override final method
  }
  ```

- **Final Class**:
  A `final` class cannot be subclassed. This is useful for creating immutable classes.

  **Example**:
  ```java
  final class MyClass {
      // Code here
  }

  // class MySubClass extends MyClass {}  // Error: cannot subclass final class
  ```

---

### **2. `finally`**

**Usage**:
The `finally` block is used in exception handling. It is always executed after the try-catch blocks, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not. It is typically used to release resources like closing files or database connections.

#### **Behavior of `finally`:**
- It is **always executed** after the try block, whether an exception is thrown or not.
- It is commonly used to **clean up resources** (like closing a file or a database connection) after the program has finished executing the code in the try-catch block.

**Example**:
```java
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
    int result = 10 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("An error occurred.");
} finally {
    System.out.println("This block is always executed.");
}
```

**Output**:
```
An error occurred.
This block is always executed.
```

- If no exception occurs, the `finally` block will still be executed.
- Even if the `catch` block contains a `return` statement, the `finally` block will still execute before returning from the method.

---

### **3. `finalize`**

**Usage**:
The `finalize()` method is used for cleanup activities before an object is garbage collected. It is a method of the `Object` class, and it is called by the Garbage Collector before an object is removed from memory. This method can be overridden to release resources or perform actions before the object is garbage collected.

#### **Key Points about `finalize`:**
- The `finalize()` method is called just **before** an object is destroyed by the garbage collector.
- **It is not recommended** to rely on `finalize()` for resource management. The JVM may not call it immediately or even at all, so it's better to explicitly release resources using `try-with-resources` or similar mechanisms.
- It has **no guarantee** of being called and should not be used for critical resource cleanup like closing file streams or database connections.

**Example**:
```java
class MyClass {
    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        // Cleanup code
        System.out.println("Object is being garbage collected.");
        super.finalize();
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj = null;  // Object becomes eligible for garbage collection
        System.gc();  // Request garbage collection (not guaranteed to run immediately)
    }
}
```

**Output** (if `finalize()` is called before garbage collection):
```
Object is being garbage collected.
```

### **Summary Table**

| **Keyword** | **Usage**                                      | **Description** |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `final`     | Used to define constants, prevent method overriding, and prevent inheritance. | Can be applied to variables, methods, and classes. |
| `finally`   | Used in exception handling to ensure that a block of code is executed after `try-catch` blocks. | Always executed after `try-catch`, even if an exception occurs. |
| `finalize`  | Used for cleanup just before an object is garbage collected. | Method of the `Object` class. Deprecated in some scenarios, not guaranteed to be called. |

---

### **Conclusion**
- Use **`final`** to create constants, prevent inheritance, or prevent method overriding.
- Use **`finally`** to ensure that cleanup code runs after a `try-catch` block, regardless of exceptions.
- **`finalize`** is used to clean up before an object is garbage collected, but its use is discouraged in favor of more reliable resource management techniques.

### **What is Serialization in Java?**

**Serialization** in Java is the process of converting an object's state into a byte stream so that it can be saved to a file, transferred over a network, or stored in memory. This process allows Java objects to be easily saved and restored, which is useful for tasks such as saving data between program executions, sending objects over a network, or persisting objects in databases.

When an object is serialized, its fields, including its values, are written into a stream. The object can then be deserialized, meaning the byte stream is read and converted back into a Java object.

---

### **How Does Serialization Work?**

1. **Serialization**:
   When an object is serialized, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) writes the object's state (its fields and their values) to a stream (like a file or a network).

2. **Deserialization**:
   Deserialization is the process of reading the byte stream and converting it back into the original object.

To make an object serializable in Java, the class must implement the `Serializable` interface, which is a marker interface (it doesn't contain any methods, but it signals to the JVM that the class can be serialized).

---

### **Steps to Serialize an Object in Java**

1. **Implement `Serializable` Interface**:
   To mark a class as serializable, it must implement the `Serializable` interface.

   ```java
   import java.io.Serializable;

   public class Student implements Serializable {
       private String name;
       private int age;

       // Constructor, getters, setters, etc.
   }
   ```

2. **Serialization (Converting Object to Byte Stream)**:
   You can serialize an object using classes like `ObjectOutputStream`.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   import java.io.FileOutputStream;
   import java.io.ObjectOutputStream;
   import java.io.IOException;

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Student student = new Student("John", 20);

           try (ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("student.ser"))) {
               oos.writeObject(student); // Serializing the student object
               System.out.println("Object serialized successfully.");
           } catch (IOException e) {
               e.printStackTrace();
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Deserialization (Converting Byte Stream back to Object)**:
   To deserialize, you use `ObjectInputStream` to read the byte stream and convert it back into the object.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   import java.io.FileInputStream;
   import java.io.ObjectInputStream;
   import java.io.IOException;

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           try (ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("student.ser"))) {
               Student student = (Student) ois.readObject(); // Deserializing the object
               System.out.println("Object deserialized: " + student.getName());
           } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) {
               e.printStackTrace();
           }
       }
   }
   ```

---

### **Important Points About Serialization**

1. **`Serializable` Interface**:
   - A class must implement the `Serializable` interface for its objects to be serializable.
   - It's a **marker interface**, meaning it doesn't contain any methods.

2. **`serialVersionUID`**:
   - The `serialVersionUID` is a unique identifier for each class that is serialized. It helps ensure that a deserialized object is compatible with the class definition. If the `serialVersionUID` of the serialized object does not match the one in the class, an `InvalidClassException` will be thrown.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
   ```

3. **Transient Keyword**:
   - The `transient` keyword can be used to mark fields that should not be serialized. These fields will be ignored during the serialization process.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   private transient String password; // Will not be serialized
   ```

4. **Serializable Object Limitations**:
   - **Non-Serializable Fields**: If a class contains fields that are not serializable (such as file streams or database connections), you may need to mark them as `transient` or handle them separately.
   - **Inheritance**: If a class extends another class, the superclass must also implement `Serializable` for the subclass to be serializable.

---

### **When to Use Serialization**

1. **Persistence**:
   Serialization is often used to save the state of an object to a file (for example, saving user data between sessions).

2. **Networking**:
   When sending objects over a network, serialization is used to convert the object into a byte stream, which can be transmitted and then deserialized at the other end.

3. **Caching**:
   In distributed systems, objects are serialized to be cached and shared between different services or servers.

---

### **Example: Full Serialization and Deserialization**

**Student Class**:
```java
import java.io.Serializable;

public class Student implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Student(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Student{name='" + name + "', age=" + age + '}';
    }
}
```

**Serialization Example**:
```java
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.ObjectOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class SerializeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student student = new Student("Alice", 22);
        try (ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("student.dat"))) {
            out.writeObject(student);
            System.out.println("Student object serialized!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

**Deserialization Example**:
```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.ObjectInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class DeserializeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("student.dat"))) {
            Student student = (Student) in.readObject();
            System.out.println("Deserialized Student: " + student);
        } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### **Conclusion**

- **Serialization** is the process of converting objects into a byte stream for storage or transmission.
- It allows objects to be saved, sent over a network, or persisted.
- For an object to be serializable in Java, the class must implement the `Serializable` interface.
- It's important to manage resources and handle fields that should not be serialized (using `transient` keyword) or require special handling (like `serialVersionUID`).


**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

<hr style="border:1px solid orange">

To make a class **serializable** in Java, you need to do the following:

### **1. Implement the Serializable Interface**

In Java, a class is made serializable by implementing the `Serializable` interface. This is a **marker interface**, meaning it does not contain any methods but indicates to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that objects of this class can be serialized.

**Example**:

```java
import java.io.Serializable;

public class Student implements Serializable {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Constructor, getters, and setters

    public Student(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
}
```

### **2. Use the `serialVersionUID` (Optional but Recommended)**

The `serialVersionUID` is a unique identifier for each class version that is serialized. This ID helps ensure that a deserialized object is compatible with the class definition. If the `serialVersionUID` of the serialized object does not match the one in the class, an `InvalidClassException` will be thrown.

It's recommended to explicitly declare the `serialVersionUID` in your class, especially when you make changes to the class. If not explicitly declared, the JVM will generate it automatically, but it's safer to define it yourself.

**Example**:

```java
private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
```

This `serialVersionUID` helps the deserialization process determine whether the version of the class being deserialized matches the version of the class used for serialization.

### **3. Handle Non-Serializable Fields (Optional)**

If your class has fields that are not serializable (for example, file streams or database connections), you need to mark them with the `transient` keyword. The `transient` keyword tells the JVM to exclude these fields from the serialization process.

**Example**:

```java
import java.io.Serializable;

public class Student implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    private String name;
    private int age;
    private transient String password; // This field will not be serialized

    // Constructor, getters, and setters
}
```

### **4. Serialization and Deserialization**

Once your class is serializable, you can use `ObjectOutputStream` to serialize the object and `ObjectInputStream` to deserialize it.

**Example of Serialization**:

```java
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.ObjectOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class SerializeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student student = new Student("Alice", 22);

        try (ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("student.dat"))) {
            out.writeObject(student);  // Serializing the student object
            System.out.println("Student object serialized!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

**Example of Deserialization**:

```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.ObjectInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class DeserializeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("student.dat"))) {
            Student student = (Student) in.readObject();  // Deserializing the student object
            System.out.println("Deserialized Student: " + student.getName());
        } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

---

### **Summary**
To make a class serializable in Java:

1. **Implement the `Serializable` interface**: This is a marker interface that tells the JVM that objects of this class can be serialized.
2. **Optionally, define a `serialVersionUID`**: This unique ID helps ensure that the serialized and deserialized objects are compatible.
3. **Handle non-serializable fields with `transient`**: If your class contains fields that should not be serialized, mark them as `transient`.

By following these steps, you ensure that your class can be serialized and deserialized properly.

### **What is the transient Keyword in Java?**

In Java, the **`transient`** keyword is used to indicate that a specific field should **not be serialized** when the object is converted into a byte stream. Serialization in Java is the process of saving the object's state to a stream (e.g., a file or over a network). However, there may be fields within an object that you don't want to include in the serialized form — these fields are marked with the `transient` keyword.

When a field is marked as `transient`, it is **excluded** from the serialization process. During **deserialization**, the value of the `transient` field is initialized to its default value (e.g., `null` for objects, `0` for integers, `false` for booleans).

---

### **Why Use `transient`?**

1. **Avoid Serializing Sensitive Data**:
   Some fields may contain sensitive information (like passwords, tokens, etc.) that you do not want to serialize because they may pose a security risk.

2. **Avoid Storing Unnecessary Data**:
   Some fields, such as references to open file handles or database connections, might not make sense to serialize because their state can't be restored upon deserialization.

3. **Save Memory**:
   By marking fields as `transient`, you can avoid serializing large or temporary data that is not needed after the object is deserialized.

---

### **How to Use the `transient` Keyword**

To use `transient`, simply place it in front of the field declaration. This tells the JVM not to serialize this field when the object is being serialized.

**Example**:

```java
import java.io.Serializable;

public class Student implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    private String name;
    private int age;
    private transient String password;  // This field will not be serialized

    public Student(String name, int age, String password) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.password = password;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public String getPassword() {
        return password;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Student{name='" + name + "', age=" + age + ", password='" + password + "'}";
    }
}
```

In the example above:
- The `name` and `age` fields will be serialized.
- The `password` field will **not** be serialized because it is marked with the `transient` keyword.

---

### **Example of Serialization and Deserialization with `transient`**

```java
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.ObjectOutputStream;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.ObjectInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class TestSerialization {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student student = new Student("Alice", 22, "password123");

        // Serialize the object
        try (ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("student.dat"))) {
            out.writeObject(student);
            System.out.println("Object serialized!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // Deserialize the object
        try (ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("student.dat"))) {
            Student deserializedStudent = (Student) in.readObject();
            System.out.println("Deserialized Student: " + deserializedStudent);
            // The password field will have the default value of null
        } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

**Output**:
```
Object serialized!
Deserialized Student: Student{name='Alice', age=22, password='null'}
```

- The `password` field, which was marked as `transient`, is not serialized and has a default value of `null` after deserialization.
- The `name` and `age` fields are serialized and retained after deserialization.

---

### **Key Points About `transient`**

1. **Exclusion from Serialization**:
   The primary purpose of `transient` is to exclude fields from being serialized when an object is serialized.

2. **Default Value After Deserialization**:
   After deserialization, the `transient` fields are initialized to their default values (e.g., `null` for objects, `0` for numbers, `false` for booleans).

3. **Only for Instance Variables**:
   The `transient` keyword can only be applied to instance variables, not to methods or classes.

4. **Works Only with Serialization**:
   The `transient` keyword has an effect only when an object is serialized using `ObjectOutputStream` and deserialized using `ObjectInputStream`. It does not affect the fields in regular object instantiation.

---

### **Conclusion**

The `transient` keyword in Java is used to mark fields in a class that should **not be serialized** when the object is converted into a byte stream. This is useful for excluding sensitive information or data that isn't needed for restoring the object after deserialization. Fields marked as `transient` will be initialized to their default values when the object is deserialized.

### ConcurrentHashMap Class in Java

`ConcurrentHashMap` is a part of the `java.util.concurrent` package and is a thread-safe implementation of the `Map` interface. It is designed for use in concurrent (multi-threaded) environments where multiple threads may be trying to read or write to the map at the same time.

Unlike `HashMap`, which is not thread-safe, `ConcurrentHashMap` allows for **concurrent reads** and **thread-safe writes** without the need for explicit synchronization.

### **Key Features of `ConcurrentHashMap`:**

1. **Thread Safety:**
   - `ConcurrentHashMap` allows multiple threads to safely read and modify the map concurrently without corrupting the map or causing exceptions.
   - The map is thread-safe for both **reads** and **writes**, but it achieves this without using a single global lock.

2. **Segmentation (Locking Strategy):**
   - In `ConcurrentHashMap`, the map is divided into **segments**, and each segment has its own lock. This allows **concurrent writes** to different segments by different threads.
   - The concurrency level is adjustable, and by default, the map is divided into 16 segments. This means that up to 16 threads can update the map concurrently, each operating on a separate segment.

3. **No Blocking Reads:**
   - Unlike some other thread-safe collections that lock the entire map during a read or write operation, `ConcurrentHashMap` allows **non-blocking reads**.
   - Reads can occur simultaneously with writes, as long as the reads do not affect the same segment that is being written to.

4. **Atomic Operations:**
   - `ConcurrentHashMap` provides atomic methods like `putIfAbsent()`, `replace()`, and `computeIfAbsent()` which perform specific operations atomically, ensuring that the map is modified correctly in concurrent environments.
   - These methods allow you to perform operations on the map without needing explicit synchronization.

5. **No Need for External Synchronization:**
   - You do not need to synchronize access to the `ConcurrentHashMap` explicitly using `synchronized` blocks. The class internally handles synchronization at the segment level.

6. **Weak Consistency:**
   - `ConcurrentHashMap` provides **weak consistency** for iterators. The iterators are **fail-safe**, meaning that they will not throw `ConcurrentModificationException` if the map is modified while the iterator is in use.
   - However, the iterator may not reflect changes made to the map during iteration, and it does not guarantee a consistent view of the map if concurrent modifications occur.

7. **Supports `null` Keys/Values:**
   - `ConcurrentHashMap` does not allow `null` keys or values. This ensures that the map can differentiate between a valid entry and a non-existent one.

### **Constructor:**

- **`ConcurrentHashMap(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor, int concurrencyLevel)`**
   - `initialCapacity`: The initial capacity of the map.
   - `loadFactor`: The load factor used to resize the map.
   - `concurrencyLevel`: The number of threads that can concurrently access the map.

- **`ConcurrentHashMap()`** (default constructor)
   - Creates a map with an initial capacity of 16, load factor of 0.75, and a concurrency level of 16.

### **Example Usage:**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ConcurrentHashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a ConcurrentHashMap with initial capacity of 4 and concurrency level 2
        ConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>(4, 0.75f, 2);

        // Add some key-value pairs
        map.put("One", 1);
        map.put("Two", 2);
        map.put("Three", 3);

        // Access the map
        System.out.println("Value for 'One': " + map.get("One"));
        System.out.println("Value for 'Two': " + map.get("Two"));

        // Perform atomic operation
        map.putIfAbsent("Four", 4);

        // Replace a value
        map.replace("One", 10);

        // Print the map contents
        System.out.println("Map: " + map);

        // Using computeIfAbsent to atomically compute a value if absent
        map.computeIfAbsent("Five", key -> key.length());
        System.out.println("Map after computeIfAbsent: " + map);
    }
}
```

### **Key Methods of `ConcurrentHashMap`:**

1. **`putIfAbsent(K key, V value)`**
   Inserts the specified key-value pair only if the key is not already associated with a value.

2. **`replace(K key, V oldValue, V newValue)`**
   Replaces the entry for a key only if the current value is equal to the specified old value.

3. **`replace(K key, V value)`**
   Replaces the entry for the specified key with the given value.

4. **`computeIfAbsent(K key, Function<? super K, ? extends V> mappingFunction)`**
   Computes the value for the key if it's not already present in the map, and inserts it atomically.

5. **`remove(Object key, Object value)`**
   Removes the entry for the key only if it is currently mapped to the specified value.

6. **`clear()`**
   Removes all mappings from the map.

7. **`keySet()` / `values()` / `entrySet()`**
   Returns views of the keys, values, or entries, respectively, in the map.

---

### **Advantages of `ConcurrentHashMap`:**

1. **Thread-Safety:**
   It is highly efficient and thread-safe for concurrent operations, and you do not need to manage synchronization explicitly.

2. **Improved Performance:**
   It allows multiple threads to perform concurrent reads and writes, improving performance in multithreaded applications.

3. **Scalable:**
   With its segment-based locking, `ConcurrentHashMap` can scale efficiently as the number of threads increases.

4. **Atomic Operations:**
   Provides atomic operations for common tasks such as adding, replacing, and removing key-value pairs.

---

### **Use Cases:**

- **Caching:**
  `ConcurrentHashMap` is often used in cache implementations, where it’s crucial to allow multiple threads to concurrently access and modify the cache.

- **Counters/Accumulators:**
  It can be used for maintaining thread-safe counters or accumulators in multi-threaded environments.

- **Shared Data Structures in Multi-threaded Applications:**
  Any application where multiple threads need to access and modify a shared map structure concurrently can benefit from `ConcurrentHashMap`.

---

### **Summary:**

| Feature                           | `ConcurrentHashMap`                          |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Thread Safety**                 | Provides thread-safe operations without external synchronization |
| **Ordering**                       | No guarantee of order (like `HashMap`) |
| **Performance**                   | Optimized for concurrent access with reduced contention |
| **Null Keys/Values**              | Does not allow `null` keys or values |
| **Atomic Operations**             | Provides atomic methods like `putIfAbsent`, `computeIfAbsent`, etc. |
| **Memory Usage**                  | Slightly more memory-intensive than `HashMap` due to internal segmentation |

---

In summary, `ConcurrentHashMap` is a powerful tool for managing key-value mappings in multi-threaded applications, ensuring thread safety and improved performance through fine-grained locking mechanisms.

### **Difference Between HashSet and TreeSet in Java**

`HashSet` and `TreeSet` are both implementations of the `Set` interface in Java, but they have some key differences in terms of performance, ordering, and behavior. Let's break down the major distinctions between the two:

---

### **1. Ordering of Elements:**

- **HashSet:**
   - **Unordered** collection. The elements in a `HashSet` are not stored in any specific order.
   - The order of the elements is determined by their **hash codes** and may appear random when iterated over.
   - It does not guarantee the order of insertion.

- **TreeSet:**
   - **Sorted** collection. The elements are stored in a sorted order, according to their **natural ordering** (if the elements implement `Comparable`) or by a **custom comparator** (if provided).
   - The elements in a `TreeSet` are always ordered when iterated.

---

### **2. Internal Data Structure:**

- **HashSet:**
   - Uses a **hash table** for storage (backed by a `HashMap` internally).
   - It relies on the **hash codes** of the elements for storage and retrieval, providing fast access.

- **TreeSet:**
   - Uses a **red-black tree** (a self-balancing binary search tree) for storage.
   - Elements are stored in a **sorted tree structure**, which ensures that the order is maintained.

---

### **3. Performance:**

- **HashSet:**
   - **Fast operations** (constant time complexity, **O(1)**) for `add()`, `remove()`, and `contains()` under normal conditions.
   - Since `HashSet` uses hashing, these operations do not depend on the size of the set, but the efficiency can degrade if the hash function is poor or there are a lot of hash collisions.

- **TreeSet:**
   - Operations like `add()`, `remove()`, and `contains()` take **O(log n)** time because they require the elements to be traversed and the tree to be balanced.
   - Slower than `HashSet` for basic operations, but provides ordered storage.

---

### **4. Null Elements:**

- **HashSet:**
   - **Allows one null element** (you can add `null` as an element to a `HashSet`).

- **TreeSet:**
   - **Does not allow null elements**. If you attempt to add `null` to a `TreeSet`, it will throw a `NullPointerException`, because `null` cannot be compared to other elements in the set to determine its order.

---

### **5. Use Cases:**

- **HashSet:**
   - Ideal when you do not need ordering and need fast performance for adding, removing, and checking if an element exists.
   - Useful when the primary goal is to store unique elements without concern for order.
   - Example: Storing unique user IDs or product codes where order does not matter.

- **TreeSet:**
   - Ideal when you need the elements to be stored in a sorted order.
   - Useful when you need to perform operations that involve sorted data, such as finding the smallest or largest elements.
   - Example: Maintaining a sorted list of elements, like sorting a collection of scores in a game.

---

### **6. Duplicates:**

- **Both `HashSet` and `TreeSet`:**
   - Neither allows duplicates. If you try to add an element that already exists in the set, it will not be added again.

---

### **7. Iterator Behavior:**

- **HashSet:**
   - The iterator of a `HashSet` provides **unordered** elements, meaning the order of elements returned during iteration is not predictable.

- **TreeSet:**
   - The iterator of a `TreeSet` provides elements in **sorted order**, either in ascending or descending order, depending on the comparator or natural ordering.

---

### **8. Memory Consumption:**

- **HashSet:**
   - Generally uses **less memory** than `TreeSet` because it only stores hash codes and does not require additional structures for ordering.

- **TreeSet:**
   - Generally uses **more memory** than `HashSet` because it needs to maintain a tree structure to keep the elements sorted.

---

### **Summary Table:**

| Feature                        | **HashSet**                               | **TreeSet**                             |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Ordering of Elements**       | Unordered (no sorting)                   | Sorted (natural order or custom comparator) |
| **Internal Data Structure**    | Hash table (backed by `HashMap`)          | Red-black tree (self-balancing binary search tree) |
| **Time Complexity**            | O(1) for basic operations (add, remove, contains) | O(log n) for basic operations (add, remove, contains) |
| **Null Elements**              | Allows one null element                  | Does not allow null elements           |
| **Memory Usage**               | Lower memory consumption                  | Higher memory consumption due to tree structure |
| **Use Case**                   | Fast operations without ordering          | Operations requiring sorted order      |
| **Duplicates**                 | Does not allow duplicates                 | Does not allow duplicates              |

---

### **Example:**

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SetExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // HashSet Example (unordered)
        Set<String> hashSet = new HashSet<>();
        hashSet.add("Apple");
        hashSet.add("Banana");
        hashSet.add("Cherry");
        hashSet.add("Apple"); // Duplicate entry, won't be added

        System.out.println("HashSet: " + hashSet);  // Output order is not guaranteed

        // TreeSet Example (sorted)
        Set<String> treeSet = new TreeSet<>();
        treeSet.add("Apple");
        treeSet.add("Banana");
        treeSet.add("Cherry");
        treeSet.add("Apple"); // Duplicate entry, won't be added

        System.out.println("TreeSet: " + treeSet);  // Output will be in sorted order
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
HashSet: [Banana, Apple, Cherry]  // Unordered
TreeSet: [Apple, Banana, Cherry]  // Sorted
```

---

### **Conclusion:**

- **`HashSet`** is great for **performance** when you don't care about the order of elements, and you need fast access.
- **`TreeSet`** is ideal when you need **sorted elements** and are willing to trade off some performance for ordering.

### Systemoutprintln in Java

`System.out.println()` is one of the most commonly used methods in Java for printing output to the console.

Let's break down its components:

---

### **1. `System`:**
- `System` is a predefined class in Java from the `java.lang` package. It provides access to system-level resources, such as standard input, output, and error streams.

---

### **2. `out`:**
- `out` is a **static field** of the `System` class, and it represents the **standard output stream** (the console or terminal).
- It is an instance of `PrintStream`, which provides methods for printing data to the console.

---

### **3. `println()`:**
- `println()` is a **method** of the `PrintStream` class (which is the type of the `out` field). It prints the provided data to the console followed by a **newline** (i.e., moves the cursor to the next line after printing).
- `println()` automatically converts data to a string representation if it is not already a string.

---

### **Usage of `System.out.println()`:**

- **Printing text or data:**
   - You can pass strings, variables, or expressions to `System.out.println()` to print them to the console.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Printing a string
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");

        // Printing a number
        int number = 10;
        System.out.println("The number is: " + number);

        // Printing multiple values (using concatenation)
        System.out.println("Sum of 5 and 3 is: " + (5 + 3));

        // Printing an object (calls toString() automatically)
        Person person = new Person("John", 25);
        System.out.println(person); // Calls person's toString() method
    }
}

class Person {
    String name;
    int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Override toString() method to customize the output
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age;
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, World!
The number is: 10
Sum of 5 and 3 is: 8
Name: John, Age: 25
```

---

### **Key Points:**
- `println()` automatically adds a new line at the end of the output.
- If you do not want a new line after the output, you can use `System.out.print()` instead.
- `System.out.println()` is typically used for debugging or logging information to the console in simple programs.

---

### **Conclusion:**
`System.out.println()` is a simple yet essential tool for printing output to the console in Java programs. It is often used for testing, debugging, and displaying program results.

### **What is a Memory Leak?**

A **memory leak** occurs when a program unintentionally retains memory that is no longer needed, preventing that memory from being reclaimed by the garbage collector. This results in the program using more and more memory over time, which can lead to performance degradation or even application crashes.

In Java, the **garbage collector** is responsible for freeing memory that is no longer in use. However, if objects are still referenced (even if they are not needed), they won't be eligible for garbage collection, causing a memory leak.

---

### **Common Causes of Memory Leaks in Java:**

Here are some common causes that can lead to memory leaks in Java applications:

---

### **1. Unclosed Resources (e.g., Streams, Connections):**

- **Problem:** If resources like file streams, network connections, database connections, etc., are not properly closed after use, they can prevent the objects from being garbage collected. For example, leaving an open `InputStream` or `OutputStream` object without closing it can result in a memory leak.

- **Solution:** Always close resources in a `finally` block or use the **try-with-resources** statement in Java 7 and later.

```java
try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("file.txt")) {
    // use fis
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
// fis will automatically be closed here
```

---

### **2. Static References:**

- **Problem:** If an object is referenced by a **static variable**, it will not be eligible for garbage collection, as static variables live throughout the application's lifecycle.

- **Solution:** Avoid using static references unless absolutely necessary. If static references are needed, make sure to nullify them when they are no longer required.

```java
public class MyClass {
    private static SomeObject obj;

    public static void someMethod() {
        obj = new SomeObject(); // obj is referenced throughout the application's lifecycle
    }
}
```

---

### **3. Holding References in Collections:**

- **Problem:** If objects are added to collections (e.g., `List`, `Set`, `Map`) and not removed when no longer needed, they will remain in memory because the collection holds a reference to them.

- **Solution:** Always ensure to remove objects from collections when they are no longer required.

```java
List<MyObject> list = new ArrayList<>();
MyObject obj = new MyObject();
list.add(obj);

// Later, remove the object if it's no longer needed
list.remove(obj); // Prevents memory leak
```

---

### **4. Circular References:**

- **Problem:** If two or more objects reference each other in a circular manner, the garbage collector may not be able to detect that they are no longer in use, causing a memory leak.

- **Solution:** Java’s garbage collector can handle circular references, but it cannot detect leaks caused by objects that are still reachable via indirect references. Be careful of such references, and use weak references when appropriate.

```java
public class A {
    private B b;

    public void setB(B b) {
        this.b = b;
    }
}

public class B {
    private A a;

    public void setA(A a) {
        this.a = a;
    }
}
```

---

### **5. Unused Object References:**

- **Problem:** If objects are not properly dereferenced (i.e., not set to `null` when no longer needed), they will remain in memory even if they are not used anymore.

- **Solution:** Set objects to `null` when you no longer need them, especially for large objects or objects holding significant resources.

```java
MyObject obj = new MyObject();
// Later in the code, if obj is no longer needed, set it to null
obj = null;  // Now obj is eligible for garbage collection
```

---

### **6. Large Object Caches:**

- **Problem:** Caching large objects without limiting their size or clearing them when they are no longer needed can cause a memory leak.

- **Solution:** Use appropriate cache management strategies, like **weak references** or **limited-size caches** (e.g., using `LinkedHashMap` with a maximum size).

---

### **7. Listener and Observer Patterns:**

- **Problem:** In Java, objects often register themselves as listeners or observers to listen for events. If the listeners are not properly removed or deregistered, they may still hold references to objects even after they are no longer needed.

- **Solution:** Always unregister listeners or observers when they are no longer required.

```java
eventSource.removeListener(myListener); // Remove listener to prevent memory leak
```

---

### **8. Improper Use of `ThreadLocal`:**

- **Problem:** `ThreadLocal` variables store data that is specific to a thread. If not handled properly, such as not removing references after the thread finishes execution, it can lead to a memory leak. The thread-local value may be retained in the thread's local storage even after the thread has finished its execution.

- **Solution:** Always remove the `ThreadLocal` value when it is no longer required.

```java
ThreadLocal<String> threadLocal = new ThreadLocal<>();
threadLocal.set("Hello");
// Make sure to call remove when done
threadLocal.remove(); // Prevents memory leak
```

---

### **9. Incorrect Use of Finalizer Methods:**

- **Problem:** If a class implements a `finalize()` method, and the `finalize()` method retains references to objects that should be garbage collected, it may prevent those objects from being cleaned up. The `finalize()` method is invoked just before an object is garbage collected, and if not implemented correctly, it can lead to a memory leak.

- **Solution:** Avoid overriding `finalize()` unless necessary. If it is used, ensure no unnecessary references are retained.

---

### **10. Leaking Memory in JNI (Java Native Interface):**

- **Problem:** When Java code interacts with native code (via JNI), native memory is used, which is not subject to Java’s garbage collection. Improperly managing native resources can lead to memory leaks.

- **Solution:** Always free native resources when no longer needed using the appropriate cleanup mechanisms (e.g., `free()` or equivalent).

---

### **Detecting and Avoiding Memory Leaks:**

- **Use Profilers:** Tools like **VisualVM**, **YourKit**, and **JProfiler** can help detect memory leaks by monitoring memory usage over time and identifying objects that are not being garbage collected.

- **Heap Dumps:** Analyzing heap dumps (via tools like **Eclipse Memory Analyzer Tool**) can help identify objects that are taking up too much memory and which references are preventing them from being garbage collected.

- **Code Review:** Regular code reviews and careful attention to resource management practices (like closing streams, removing references, etc.) can significantly reduce the risk of memory leaks.

---

### **Conclusion:**

Memory leaks are a serious issue in Java applications because they gradually consume system memory and may lead to performance problems or application crashes. By being mindful of common causes like unclosed resources, static references, and circular dependencies, developers can significantly reduce the likelihood of memory leaks in their programs.

### **What is Object Cloning in Java?**

**Object cloning** in Java refers to the process of creating an exact copy of an object. The clone is a new object with the same values as the original object. Cloning is typically used when you need a copy of an object that is independent of the original object, meaning changes to the cloned object will not affect the original object.

---

### **How Object Cloning Works:**

Java provides two main ways to clone an object:

1. **Shallow Cloning**
2. **Deep Cloning**

---

### **1. Shallow Cloning:**
Shallow cloning creates a new object with the same values as the original object, but if the object contains references to other objects, those references are copied, not the objects themselves. This means both the original and cloned objects will point to the same memory locations for the referenced objects.

#### **Shallow Cloning Example:**
```java
class Person implements Cloneable {
    String name;
    int age;
    Address address;

    public Person(String name, int age, Address address) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.address = address;
    }

    // Implementing clone() method
    @Override
    public Person clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        return (Person) super.clone(); // Shallow copy
    }
}

class Address {
    String city;
    String state;

    public Address(String city, String state) {
        this.city = city;
        this.state = state;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        Address address = new Address("New York", "NY");
        Person originalPerson = new Person("John", 30, address);

        // Cloning the original person
        Person clonedPerson = originalPerson.clone();

        // Modifying the cloned person's address
        clonedPerson.address.city = "Los Angeles";

        // Both the original and cloned person share the same address reference
        System.out.println("Original Person's Address: " + originalPerson.address.city);  // Output: Los Angeles
        System.out.println("Cloned Person's Address: " + clonedPerson.address.city);      // Output: Los Angeles
    }
}
```

In the above example, both `originalPerson` and `clonedPerson` share the same `address` object reference. Changing the address of one person affects the other because the reference to the `Address` object is copied, not the object itself.

---

### **2. Deep Cloning:**
Deep cloning involves creating a new object and also making copies of the objects referenced by the original object. In deep cloning, the entire object graph is copied, and the cloned object does not share any references with the original object, meaning changes to the cloned object's referenced objects will not affect the original object.

#### **Deep Cloning Example:**
```java
class Person implements Cloneable {
    String name;
    int age;
    Address address;

    public Person(String name, int age, Address address) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.address = address;
    }

    // Deep copy using custom clone implementation
    @Override
    public Person clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        // Clone the Person object (shallow copy)
        Person clonedPerson = (Person) super.clone();

        // Perform deep copy for the address object
        clonedPerson.address = new Address(this.address.city, this.address.state);

        return clonedPerson;
    }
}

class Address {
    String city;
    String state;

    public Address(String city, String state) {
        this.city = city;
        this.state = state;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        Address address = new Address("New York", "NY");
        Person originalPerson = new Person("John", 30, address);

        // Cloning the original person (deep clone)
        Person clonedPerson = originalPerson.clone();

        // Modifying the cloned person's address
        clonedPerson.address.city = "Los Angeles";

        // The original person's address is not affected
        System.out.println("Original Person's Address: " + originalPerson.address.city);  // Output: New York
        System.out.println("Cloned Person's Address: " + clonedPerson.address.city);      // Output: Los Angeles
    }
}
```

In this example, the `clone()` method in the `Person` class creates a **deep copy** of the `Address` object. Thus, modifying the `address` in the cloned `Person` does not affect the original `Person` object.

---

### **`Cloneable` Interface:**

For cloning to work in Java, the class must implement the `Cloneable` interface. This interface does not contain any methods, but it serves as a marker to indicate that the object is eligible for cloning.

If a class does not implement `Cloneable` and its `clone()` method is called, it will throw a `CloneNotSupportedException`.

#### **Example of the `Cloneable` Interface:**
```java
class MyClass implements Cloneable {
    int x;

    public MyClass(int x) {
        this.x = x;
    }

    @Override
    public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        return super.clone();
    }
}
```

---

### **Why Use Cloning?**

Cloning is useful in scenarios like:
- **Creating copies of objects**: When you need a duplicate of an object but want to ensure that changes to the clone do not affect the original object.
- **Avoiding shared references**: Cloning is used to avoid shared references to mutable objects, especially in cases where modifications to the cloned object should not affect the original object.

---

### **Limitations and Considerations:**

- **Performance Overhead**: Cloning an object, especially for deep cloning, can be expensive in terms of performance, especially for large object graphs.
- **Cloning Complex Objects**: If the object contains non-cloneable fields, you may need to implement custom cloning logic to handle them.
- **Copy Constructors**: Sometimes, it's better to use a copy constructor (a constructor that takes an instance of the same class and copies its data) instead of cloning.

---

### **Conclusion:**

- **Shallow cloning** only creates a copy of the object but not of the objects it refers to.
- **Deep cloning** creates a completely new object along with new copies of the objects it refers to.
- **Object cloning** is commonly used for making copies of objects when you need to ensure that changes to one object do not affect others. To implement cloning in Java, a class must implement the `Cloneable` interface and override the `clone()` method.

### **Wrapper Classes in Java**

In Java, **Wrapper classes** are used to convert primitive data types into objects. Each primitive data type (such as `int`, `char`, `boolean`, etc.) has a corresponding wrapper class that allows the primitive value to be treated as an object.

For example, the wrapper class for the primitive type `int` is `Integer`, for `char` it is `Character`, and so on.

### **Why Wrapper Classes?**
- **Object representation**: Primitive types cannot be used in certain scenarios where objects are required (e.g., in **collections** such as `ArrayList`, which only works with objects). Wrapper classes allow primitive values to be used as objects.
- **Utility methods**: Wrapper classes provide utility methods for converting between different types, parsing strings to primitive values, and more.
- **Autoboxing and Unboxing**: Java provides automatic conversion between primitives and wrapper classes (known as autoboxing and unboxing).

### **List of Wrapper Classes for Primitive Types:**
| Primitive Type | Wrapper Class |
|----------------|---------------|
| `byte`         | `Byte`        |
| `short`        | `Short`       |
| `int`          | `Integer`     |
| `long`         | `Long`        |
| `float`        | `Float`       |
| `double`       | `Double`      |
| `char`         | `Character`   |
| `boolean`      | `Boolean`     |

---

### **Features of Wrapper Classes:**

1. **Encapsulation of Primitive Data Types**:
   - Wrapper classes encapsulate the corresponding primitive type in an object.
   - Example: The `Integer` class wraps the primitive `int` in an object.

2. **Utility Methods**:
   Wrapper classes provide methods to convert between primitive types and strings.
   - `parseInt(String s)`: Converts a string to an `int`.
   - `toString()`: Converts a primitive or wrapper object to a string.
   - `valueOf(String s)`: Converts a string to the corresponding wrapper object.

   ```java
   int num = Integer.parseInt("123"); // Converts string to int
   String str = Integer.toString(123); // Converts int to string
   Integer integer = Integer.valueOf("123"); // Converts string to Integer object
   ```

3. **Constants**:
   Many wrapper classes have constants that represent the minimum and maximum values for the corresponding primitive data types:
   - `Byte.MIN_VALUE`, `Byte.MAX_VALUE`
   - `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, `Integer.MAX_VALUE`

4. **Autoboxing and Unboxing**:
   - **Autoboxing**: Automatically converting a primitive type to its wrapper class.
   - **Unboxing**: Automatically converting a wrapper class object back to the primitive type.

   ```java
   Integer obj = 10; // Autoboxing: primitive int is automatically converted to Integer object
   int value = obj;  // Unboxing: Integer object is automatically converted back to primitive int
   ```

5. **Immutability**:
   - Wrapper classes are immutable. Once created, their values cannot be changed.

---

### **Example Usage of Wrapper Classes:**

```java
public class WrapperExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Autoboxing: converting primitive to object
        Integer intObj = 100;
        Double doubleObj = 10.5;

        // Unboxing: converting object to primitive
        int primitiveInt = intObj;
        double primitiveDouble = doubleObj;

        System.out.println("Autoboxed Integer: " + intObj);      // Output: 100
        System.out.println("Autoboxed Double: " + doubleObj);    // Output: 10.5
        System.out.println("Unboxed int: " + primitiveInt);      // Output: 100
        System.out.println("Unboxed double: " + primitiveDouble); // Output: 10.5

        // Using wrapper class methods
        int parsedInt = Integer.parseInt("123");
        String str = Integer.toString(456);

        System.out.println("Parsed integer: " + parsedInt);      // Output: 123
        System.out.println("Converted string: " + str);          // Output: "456"

        // Checking constants in wrapper classes
        System.out.println("Maximum Integer value: " + Integer.MAX_VALUE); // Output: 2147483647
        System.out.println("Minimum Integer value: " + Integer.MIN_VALUE); // Output: -2147483648
    }
}
```

### **When to Use Wrapper Classes:**

- When you need to store primitive values in data structures like `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, etc., since these structures only work with objects.
- When you need to pass primitive values to methods that accept objects.
- When you need utility methods for parsing, conversion, and manipulation of primitive values.
- When you want to perform operations with objects, such as using them in collections or in reflection.

---

### **Conclusion:**
Wrapper classes in Java allow primitive data types to be used as objects, providing useful features like autoboxing, utility methods, constants, and more. These classes are essential in scenarios where objects are required instead of primitives, such as when using collections or working with APIs that expect objects.

### **Creation of a String using new vs String Literal**

In Java, Strings can be created in two main ways:
1. **Using a String literal** (e.g., `"Hello"`)
2. **Using the `new` keyword** (e.g., `new String("Hello")`)

Although both methods create a String object with the same value, there are important differences in terms of **memory allocation** and **performance**. Let’s explore them in detail:

---

### **1. String Literal (`"Hello"`)**

When you create a string using a literal, it is automatically added to the **string pool** (also known as the string constant pool).

#### **How it works:**
- If the string literal already exists in the string pool, **no new object** is created. Instead, a reference to the existing string object is returned.
- If the string literal doesn't exist in the pool, it is **created and added** to the string pool.

#### **Example:**
```java
String str1 = "Hello";
String str2 = "Hello";
```

- In this case, both `str1` and `str2` will point to the **same string object** in the string pool, avoiding duplication in memory.
- Since string literals are interned, they save memory and improve performance by reusing existing strings.

#### **Advantages:**
- **Memory efficient**: String literals are stored in the string pool, which ensures that the same string is reused.
- **Faster comparison**: String literals can be compared using the `==` operator, as they point to the same object.

---

### **2. String Creation Using `new()` (`new String("Hello")`)**

When you use the `new` keyword to create a string, a **new String object** is created in the heap memory, regardless of whether the string already exists in the string pool or not.

#### **How it works:**
- When you create a string using `new String("Hello")`, it first checks the string pool to see if the literal `"Hello"` already exists.
- If it does exist, it creates a new object in the **heap memory** that contains the same value but does not refer to the string pool. If it doesn’t exist, it first adds the string to the pool and then creates a new object in the heap.

#### **Example:**
```java
String str3 = new String("Hello");
String str4 = new String("Hello");
```

- Here, `str3` and `str4` will **not** point to the same object in memory, even though they both have the same value. Instead, each will refer to a **separate string object** in the heap.

#### **Disadvantages:**
- **Memory overhead**: Using `new String()` creates an extra object in the heap, even if the same string value already exists in the string pool.
- **Slower comparison**: Because each `new String()` creates a new object, the `==` operator will return `false` when comparing two strings created this way, even if they have the same value. You would need to use `.equals()` to compare the values.

---

### **Key Differences:**

| Feature                     | String Literal (`"Hello"`)               | String Using `new` (`new String("Hello")`)   |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Memory Location**          | Stored in the string pool (interned)     | Created in the heap memory (not interned)   |
| **Object Reuse**             | Reuses existing objects from the pool    | Creates a new object every time            |
| **Performance**              | Faster due to object reuse               | Slower due to creating a new object in the heap |
| **Comparison (`==`)**        | Returns `true` if both refer to the same object | Returns `false` unless explicitly interned |
| **Memory Efficiency**        | More memory efficient (no duplication)   | Less memory efficient (duplicate objects)   |
| **Example**                  | `String str = "Hello";`                  | `String str = new String("Hello");`         |

---

### **Conclusion:**

- **String literals** are more memory-efficient and faster because they are interned in the string pool, and Java reuses them. If you use string literals with the same value, they will refer to the same object.
- **Using `new String()`** creates new objects on the heap, which can lead to unnecessary memory consumption if the string value is already present in the pool.

In most cases, you should prefer using string literals to save memory and improve performance unless there is a specific reason to create a new string object explicitly with `new`.

### **Java String Pool**

The **Java String Pool** is a special memory region in Java where **String literals** are stored. It is also known as the **string constant pool** or **string interning**. The primary goal of the string pool is to **save memory** and **improve performance** by reusing **identical string literals** instead of creating new objects in memory.

### **How It Works:**

- When you create a **String literal** (e.g., `"Hello"`), Java checks if that exact string already exists in the string pool.
- If the string already exists in the pool, **no new object is created**. Instead, Java simply returns a reference to the existing object.
- If the string does not exist in the pool, it is added to the pool and a new object is created.

This way, if multiple places in the program use the same string literal, they all refer to the **same object** in memory, reducing memory usage.

### **Example of String Pool:**
```java
public class StringPoolExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str1 = "Hello";
        String str2 = "Hello";

        // Both str1 and str2 refer to the same object in the string pool.
        System.out.println(str1 == str2); // Output: true
    }
}
```

- In the example above, both `str1` and `str2` point to the **same object** in the string pool because they have the same value `"Hello"`.
- The `==` operator returns `true` because both references point to the same object.

### **How String Pool Helps:**
1. **Memory Efficiency**:
   - Instead of creating new objects for every instance of a string literal, the string pool ensures that only one copy of each unique string is stored in memory.
   - Multiple variables can refer to the same string object in the pool, reducing memory consumption.

2. **Faster Comparisons**:
   - Since string literals are stored in the pool and are shared, you can use the `==` operator to compare string references. If both strings refer to the same object in the pool, the comparison will return `true`.

3. **Reduced Object Creation**:
   - If you use the string literal `"Hello"` multiple times in your program, it will always refer to the same object in memory, which avoids unnecessary object creation.

### **String Pool and `new String()`**

When you create a string using the `new` keyword, like `new String("Hello")`, a **new object is created** in the **heap** memory, not in the string pool. However, Java will still check if the string literal `"Hello"` is in the string pool. If it isn't already, it will add it.

```java
String str1 = "Hello"; // Created in the string pool
String str2 = new String("Hello"); // Created in the heap memory (not in the pool)

System.out.println(str1 == str2);  // Output: false (Different objects)
System.out.println(str1.equals(str2)); // Output: true (Same value)
```

- `str1` points to the string pool, while `str2` points to a new object in the heap, even though they contain the same value `"Hello"`. Hence, `==` returns `false`, but `.equals()` returns `true` because the values are identical.

### **Where is the String Pool Stored?**

- The string pool is typically stored in the **PermGen** (Permanent Generation) or **Metaspace** area in the Java memory heap, depending on the version of Java.
   - In **Java 7 and later**, the string pool is stored in the **heap memory**.
   - In **Java 6 and earlier**, the string pool was stored in the **PermGen space**.

### **Key Points About String Pool:**

1. **Interning**: The process of storing strings in the string pool is called **string interning**.
2. **Automatic Management**: The string pool is managed automatically by the JVM.
3. **No Duplicates**: If the same literal string is used multiple times, it won't create duplicates; instead, it reuses the same object from the pool.
4. **String immutability**: Strings are immutable, meaning once they are created, they cannot be modified. This makes them safe to share across multiple places in the application.
5. **Custom String Pooling**: You can manually add strings to the pool using the `intern()` method:
   ```java
   String str3 = new String("World");
   String str4 = str3.intern(); // Adds "World" to the string pool if it's not already there
   ```

### **Conclusion:**

The **Java String Pool** is a memory optimization technique where string literals are stored for reuse. This reduces memory consumption and improves performance by avoiding the creation of duplicate string objects. By using string literals, you can leverage the benefits of the string pool, and by using methods like `.intern()`, you can explicitly add strings to the pool for better memory management.

### **Daemon Thread in Java**

A **Daemon thread** is a special type of thread in Java that runs in the background to perform tasks that support the **main application** or **non-daemon threads**. Daemon threads are typically used for **background tasks**, such as garbage collection, monitoring, or housekeeping tasks, and do not prevent the program from terminating if all non-daemon threads have finished executing.

### **Key Characteristics of Daemon Threads:**

1. **Background Tasks**:
   - Daemon threads are generally used to perform background tasks that are **not critical** to the application's main functionality.
   - For example, tasks like garbage collection, periodic logging, or resource monitoring are usually handled by daemon threads.

2. **Program Termination**:
   - A Java program **terminates when all non-daemon threads have finished** execution, regardless of whether any daemon threads are still running.
   - Daemon threads are **terminated automatically** when there are no more non-daemon threads running, meaning they don’t keep the program alive.

3. **Low Priority**:
   - Daemon threads have a **lower priority** compared to normal (user) threads. This means they can be stopped as soon as all non-daemon threads complete, even if they haven’t finished their execution.

4. **Automatic Termination**:
   - When the **main thread** or all **non-daemon threads** in the program terminate, **daemon threads are also automatically terminated** by the JVM. Daemon threads don't prevent the program from shutting down.

5. **Set by `setDaemon(true)`**:
   - A thread can be set as a daemon thread by calling `setDaemon(true)` before starting the thread.
   - If you try to set a thread as daemon after it has already started, a `IllegalThreadStateException` will be thrown.

### **Example of a Daemon Thread**:
```java
public class DaemonThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a normal (non-daemon) thread
        Thread userThread = new Thread(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                try {
                    System.out.println("User thread running");
                    Thread.sleep(2000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        });

        // Create a daemon thread
        Thread daemonThread = new Thread(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                while (true) {
                    System.out.println("Daemon thread is running...");
                    try {
                        Thread.sleep(1000);
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                }
            }
        });

        // Set the daemon thread
        daemonThread.setDaemon(true);

        // Start the threads
        userThread.start();
        daemonThread.start();

        try {
            // Let the user thread run for a while
            Thread.sleep(3000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // After the main thread finishes, the daemon thread will be terminated automatically.
        System.out.println("Main thread is finished");
    }
}
```

#### **Output:**
```
User thread running
Daemon thread is running...
Daemon thread is running...
Daemon thread is running...
Main thread is finished
```

In the example above:
- The **user thread** runs for 2 seconds and completes its execution.
- The **daemon thread** runs in the background, printing messages every second.
- Once the main thread finishes, the **daemon thread is automatically terminated** by the JVM because there are no remaining non-daemon threads.

### **Important Points About Daemon Threads:**

1. **Cannot Block Program Termination**:
   - Daemon threads **do not block the termination of the program**. As soon as all non-daemon threads finish, the JVM will terminate, even if daemon threads are still running.

2. **When to Use Daemon Threads**:
   - Daemon threads are useful for background tasks such as logging, data backups, or cleaning up resources that do not need to prevent the program from exiting.

3. **Default Behavior**:
   - By default, **main thread** and all threads created from it are **non-daemon threads**.
   - Any thread can be made daemon using `setDaemon(true)` before starting it.

4. **Cannot Be Started After Started**:
   - If you attempt to set a thread as a daemon after it has started, Java will throw an `IllegalThreadStateException`.

5. **Life Cycle**:
   - The life cycle of daemon threads is controlled by the life cycle of non-daemon threads. When all non-daemon threads terminate, daemon threads are also terminated by the JVM automatically.

---

### **Conclusion:**
Daemon threads in Java are used for background tasks that do not need to prevent the JVM from shutting down. They are typically low-priority threads that run indefinitely until all non-daemon threads finish execution. They are automatically terminated when the program ends, and they don't block the application from terminating. Daemon threads are useful for tasks like garbage collection, logging, or monitoring.

### **The finalize() Method in Java**

The `finalize()` method in Java is a special method that is part of the `java.lang.Object` class. It is called by the **Garbage Collector (GC)** just before an object is **garbage collected**. It provides an opportunity to perform cleanup activities, such as releasing resources or closing open files before the object is destroyed.

### **How Many Times is `finalize()` Called?**

The `finalize()` method is typically **called only once** for an object, and this occurs just before the object is collected by the garbage collector. Here’s why:

1. **First and Only Invocation**:
   - The `finalize()` method is called by the garbage collector only **once**, when the object is about to be garbage collected.
   - After this, the object is discarded, and no further calls to `finalize()` will be made for that object.

2. **If `finalize()` Resurrects an Object**:
   - If the `finalize()` method explicitly **resurrects the object** (e.g., by setting a reference to it), the object might not be garbage collected immediately, but that doesn’t mean `finalize()` will be called again.
   - If the object is resurrected, it may remain in memory, but the `finalize()` method will not be called a second time for the same object.

3. **Garbage Collection is Non-Deterministic**:
   - The exact time when the garbage collector will run is not predictable. It's controlled by the JVM and depends on factors like available memory and garbage collection algorithms.
   - This means that the `finalize()` method may not be called immediately after an object becomes eligible for garbage collection. It might take some time before the garbage collector gets around to it.

4. **Deprecated in Java 9**:
   - In **Java 9 and later**, the `finalize()` method is **deprecated** because it has several issues (such as performance problems and lack of guarantees on execution), and it is not recommended to rely on it for resource cleanup. Instead, Java recommends using **try-with-resources** (for AutoCloseable objects) or explicitly overriding the `close()` method to release resources.

---

### **Example:**

```java
class MyClass {
    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        System.out.println("finalize() method is called.");
    }
}

public class FinalizeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj = null;  // Make the object eligible for garbage collection

        // Suggest JVM to perform garbage collection
        System.gc();  // Request to run the garbage collector (not guaranteed)

        // Wait for the garbage collection to complete (just for demonstration)
        try {
            Thread.sleep(2000);  // Give enough time for garbage collection to occur
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
finalize() method is called.
```

- In the above example, the `finalize()` method is called when the `MyClass` object is about to be garbage collected. This happens only **once**.

---

### **Key Points About `finalize()`**:

1. **Called Once**: The `finalize()` method is invoked only once for each object, just before the object is garbage collected.
2. **Non-Deterministic**: The exact time when `finalize()` is called depends on the garbage collector's behavior.
3. **No Guarantee**: There's no guarantee that `finalize()` will be called at all if the object is not garbage collected.
4. **Not Recommended**: The `finalize()` method is deprecated in Java 9 and later. Instead, use proper resource management techniques like `try-with-resources` or explicit cleanup methods.
5. **Resurrection**: If you manually resurrect an object within the `finalize()` method (e.g., by assigning it to a live reference), the object might avoid garbage collection, but `finalize()` will not be called again.

### **Conclusion:**
The `finalize()` method is typically called only once per object before garbage collection. However, with Java’s deprecation of this method, it's better to use modern approaches (like `AutoCloseable`) for resource management and cleanup tasks.

### **What is Multithreading?**

**Multithreading** is a programming technique in which multiple threads are executed concurrently within a single program. A **thread** is the smallest unit of a CPU's execution, and multithreading allows a program to perform multiple tasks at the same time, improving its efficiency and performance.

In simpler terms, multithreading allows different parts of a program (or tasks) to run simultaneously, enabling the application to be more responsive and efficient, especially in scenarios involving multiple users or intensive operations.

### **Key Concepts of Multithreading**:

1. **Thread**:
   - A thread is an independent path of execution within a program.
   - Each thread has its own execution stack and can run code concurrently with other threads.

2. **Main Thread**:
   - Every Java application starts with a **main thread** that is created by the JVM when the program starts.
   - Other threads (worker threads) can be created to run concurrently with the main thread.

3. **Concurrency vs Parallelism**:
   - **Concurrency** refers to the ability of a system to handle multiple tasks at once but not necessarily simultaneously. In a single-core CPU, threads are time-sliced, so only one thread is executing at any given time, but the system switches between threads rapidly, giving the illusion of simultaneous execution.
   - **Parallelism** refers to running multiple threads or tasks at the same time on multiple CPU cores. This is possible in multi-core processors.

---

### **Why Use Multithreading?**

1. **Improved Performance**:
   - By executing multiple threads simultaneously, programs can accomplish more tasks in less time, improving overall efficiency and performance, especially on multi-core processors.

2. **Better Resource Utilization**:
   - Multithreading helps in making better use of CPU resources, especially in cases where tasks are independent and can be run in parallel.

3. **Responsiveness**:
   - In applications with user interfaces (e.g., GUI applications), multithreading can help maintain responsiveness by ensuring that time-consuming tasks (like file I/O or network communication) run in the background without freezing the main UI thread.

4. **Asynchronous Operations**:
   - Multithreading allows tasks like downloading files or processing data asynchronously without blocking the main program flow. This is commonly seen in web servers, games, or apps that need to handle multiple requests at once.

---

### **How to Implement Multithreading in Java**:

Java provides two primary ways to implement multithreading:

#### **1. Extending the Thread class**:
- You can create a new class that extends the `Thread` class and override its `run()` method, which contains the code that will be executed by the thread.

   ```java
   class MyThread extends Thread {
       public void run() {
           System.out.println("Thread is running");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
           t1.start();  // Starts the thread and invokes the run() method
       }
   }
   ```

#### **2. Implementing the Runnable interface**:
- Another way is to implement the `Runnable` interface and pass it to a `Thread` object. This allows a class to extend another class while still creating a thread.

   ```java
   class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
       public void run() {
           System.out.println("Thread is running");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           MyRunnable myRunnable = new MyRunnable();
           Thread t1 = new Thread(myRunnable);
           t1.start();  // Starts the thread and invokes the run() method
       }
   }
   ```

---

### **Thread Life Cycle**:
A thread goes through various stages during its lifecycle:
1. **New**: A thread is created but not yet started.
2. **Runnable**: The thread is ready to run and is waiting for the CPU to assign it execution time.
3. **Blocked**: The thread is waiting to acquire a resource, like I/O or a lock.
4. **Waiting**: The thread is waiting for a specific condition to occur.
5. **Terminated**: The thread has completed its task or was manually stopped.

---

### **Common Multithreading Problems**:
1. **Race Condition**:
   - A race condition occurs when multiple threads access shared data at the same time, and the outcome depends on the timing of thread execution. It can lead to unpredictable behavior.

2. **Deadlock**:
   - Deadlock happens when two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release resources. This results in the program being stuck.

3. **Thread Interference**:
   - Thread interference happens when two threads try to update shared data at the same time, causing inconsistent or incorrect data.

---

### **Thread Synchronization**:
To address the issues like race conditions, Java provides **synchronization** to control access to shared resources. This ensures that only one thread can access a resource at a time.

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    // Synchronized method to ensure thread safety
    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `increment()` method is synchronized, meaning only one thread can execute it at a time, ensuring safe access to the `count` variable.

---

### **Benefits of Multithreading**:
1. **Better CPU Utilization**:
   - Multithreading allows better utilization of multi-core CPUs by running multiple tasks in parallel.

2. **Faster Execution**:
   - Multithreading helps in breaking down large tasks into smaller ones, leading to faster execution, especially when working with independent tasks that can run concurrently.

3. **Improved User Experience**:
   - For GUI applications, multithreading allows long-running tasks to run in the background without freezing the user interface, improving the user experience.

---

### **Conclusion**:
Multithreading is an essential technique in Java that enables concurrent execution of tasks, resulting in better performance, responsiveness, and resource utilization. It is widely used in applications that require handling multiple tasks at once, such as web servers, desktop applications, and games. However, proper management of threads and synchronization is crucial to avoid common issues like race conditions and deadlocks.

### **Difference Between Process and Thread**

| **Aspect**           | **Process**                                             | **Thread**                                           |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**       | A process is an independent program in execution that has its own memory space and resources. | A thread is a smaller unit of execution within a process that shares the same memory space and resources of the parent process. |
| **Memory Space**     | Each process has its own separate memory space.         | Threads within the same process share the same memory space. |
| **Resource Allocation** | Processes are allocated their own resources like CPU time, memory, etc. | Threads share resources like memory, file handles, and CPU time with other threads in the same process. |
| **Overhead**         | Processes have a higher overhead because each process requires its own memory and resources. | Threads are lightweight with lower overhead since they share the same resources. |
| **Execution**        | Each process executes independently.                    | Threads within a process execute concurrently or in parallel, sharing resources of the parent process. |
| **Communication**    | Inter-process communication (IPC) is required for processes to communicate with each other, which is slower and more complex. | Threads can communicate easily and efficiently within the same process as they share the same memory space. |
| **Creation**         | Creating a process is more time-consuming because of the need to allocate memory and resources. | Threads are faster to create and manage because they share the same resources of the process. |
| **Isolation**        | Processes are isolated from each other, meaning if one process crashes, it does not affect others. | Threads are not isolated from each other, so if one thread crashes, it may affect the entire process. |
| **Examples**         | A web browser running, a word processor, or a game application. | Threads within a web server or a task running concurrently in a game engine. |
| **Context Switching** | Context switching between processes is more expensive in terms of time and resources. | Context switching between threads is less expensive and faster since they share the same resources. |

### **Summary**:
- **Process**: A process is a program in execution with its own memory space and resources. It is independent of other processes, and communication between processes requires complex mechanisms (e.g., inter-process communication).
- **Thread**: A thread is a lightweight unit of execution within a process. Multiple threads within a process share the same memory space and resources, allowing for efficient communication and faster execution compared to processes. However, threads are not as isolated from each other as processes, and a failure in one thread can affect the whole process.

In short, processes are isolated and heavier, whereas threads are lightweight and share resources within a process.

<hr style="border:1px solid orange">


### **Inter-Thread Communication in Java**

**Inter-thread communication** refers to the mechanism by which multiple threads in a program can communicate and synchronize their activities. In Java, this communication is achieved using special methods provided by the `Object` class, which are used for **waiting** and **notifying** other threads. These methods enable threads to cooperate, exchange information, or synchronize their execution to avoid conflicts and ensure proper execution order.

Java provides three key methods for inter-thread communication:
- **`wait()`**
- **`notify()`**
- **`notifyAll()`**

These methods must be called within a synchronized block or method, as they are used for coordinating access to shared resources between multiple threads.

---

### **Key Concepts**:

1. **Waiting for a Condition (`wait()` method)**:
   - The `wait()` method causes the current thread to release the lock it holds and enter the waiting state. The thread will remain in this state until another thread sends a notification.
   - A thread can only call `wait()` when it holds a lock on the object.
   - After calling `wait()`, the thread goes to the **waiting state** and does not consume CPU time until it is notified.

   ```java
   synchronized (object) {
       while (!condition) {
           object.wait();  // Waits for a signal to continue
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Notifying a Waiting Thread (`notify()` method)**:
   - The `notify()` method is used to wake up a single thread that is currently in the **waiting state**. If multiple threads are waiting, one of them will be chosen to resume execution.
   - The thread that is waiting must have been put into the waiting state by another thread using `wait()`.

   ```java
   synchronized (object) {
       object.notify();  // Notifies a waiting thread
   }
   ```

3. **Notifying All Waiting Threads (`notifyAll()` method)**:
   - The `notifyAll()` method is used to wake up all threads that are in the **waiting state**.
   - This is useful when you want all waiting threads to be able to compete for resources or continue their execution.

   ```java
   synchronized (object) {
       object.notifyAll();  // Notifies all waiting threads
   }
   ```

### **How Inter-Thread Communication Works**:

Here’s how inter-thread communication typically works in a Java program:

1. One thread performs an action and then needs to wait for another condition or thread to perform some task.
2. The waiting thread calls `wait()` on an object, releasing the lock it holds.
3. Another thread performs its work and, when done, calls `notify()` or `notifyAll()` to wake up one or more waiting threads.
4. The awakened thread(s) then continue their execution once they acquire the lock.

### **Example of Inter-Thread Communication**:

In this example, one thread produces data, and another thread consumes the data. The consumer thread waits until the producer thread produces data and notifies the consumer to consume it.

```java
class ProducerConsumer {
    private int data = 0;
    private final Object lock = new Object();

    // Producer thread
    class Producer extends Thread {
        public void run() {
            synchronized (lock) {
                while (data >= 1) {
                    try {
                        lock.wait();  // Wait until data is consumed
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    }
                }
                data = 1;  // Produce data
                System.out.println("Produced data");
                lock.notify();  // Notify consumer to consume
            }
        }
    }

    // Consumer thread
    class Consumer extends Thread {
        public void run() {
            synchronized (lock) {
                while (data == 0) {
                    try {
                        lock.wait();  // Wait until data is produced
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    }
                }
                data = 0;  // Consume data
                System.out.println("Consumed data");
                lock.notify();  // Notify producer to produce more
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ProducerConsumer pc = new ProducerConsumer();
        Thread producer = pc.new Producer();
        Thread consumer = pc.new Consumer();

        producer.start();
        consumer.start();
    }
}
```

### **Explanation**:
- The **Producer** thread produces data (sets `data = 1`) and then calls `lock.notify()` to notify the **Consumer** thread.
- The **Consumer** thread waits for the data to be produced (`data == 0`) and, after consuming it (sets `data = 0`), it calls `lock.notify()` to notify the **Producer** thread that it can produce again.
- Both threads communicate through the shared `lock` object, which they synchronize on to ensure mutual exclusion and avoid race conditions.

---

### **Use Cases for Inter-Thread Communication**:
1. **Producer-Consumer Problem**:
   - A classic scenario where a producer generates data and a consumer consumes it, ensuring that the producer does not produce when the consumer has not consumed the data and vice versa.

2. **Reader-Writer Problem**:
   - Multiple threads may be reading and writing shared data. Communication is necessary to ensure that the reading and writing threads coordinate their access.

3. **Job Scheduling**:
   - In a scenario where one thread must wait for another to finish a task (e.g., completing a calculation before moving to the next stage), inter-thread communication helps in proper sequencing.

---

### **Conclusion**:
Inter-thread communication allows threads to cooperate and synchronize their work, ensuring that they can wait for certain conditions to be met before proceeding with their execution. By using `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()`, threads can communicate effectively and safely, avoiding issues like race conditions and deadlocks while sharing resources. This is a crucial aspect of multithreaded programming in Java.

### **Purpose of the wait() Method in Java**

The `wait()` method in Java is used for **inter-thread communication** and is a fundamental part of **synchronization** in multithreaded programming. It allows a thread to temporarily release the lock it holds and enter the **waiting state**, where it will remain until another thread notifies it to continue execution.

Here’s a detailed explanation:

### **Key Purposes of `wait()` Method**:

1. **Pausing a Thread**:
   - The `wait()` method causes the current thread to **pause its execution** until it is notified by another thread. The thread that calls `wait()` is placed in the **waiting state**.

2. **Releasing the Lock**:
   - While the thread is in the **waiting state**, it releases the lock or monitor that it holds on the object. This allows other threads to acquire the lock and proceed with their execution.

3. **Thread Coordination**:
   - The `wait()` method is part of the **inter-thread communication mechanism**, allowing threads to **synchronize** their actions. For example, one thread may wait for another to complete a task before it can proceed.

4. **Avoiding Busy-Waiting**:
   - Instead of repeatedly checking a condition in a loop (which is inefficient), a thread can use `wait()` to release the CPU and allow other threads to run, thus improving performance.

### **How It Works**:
- The `wait()` method must be called inside a **synchronized block** or method because the object that a thread is waiting on must be locked.
- When a thread calls `wait()`, it will release the lock on the object and enter the **waiting state**.
- The thread will remain in the waiting state until it is notified by another thread, which can call the `notify()` or `notifyAll()` method to wake it up.

### **Syntax**:

```java
synchronized (object) {
    while (condition) {
        object.wait();  // Current thread waits for the condition to change
    }
}
```

- The `object.wait()` call will make the current thread release the lock and wait until another thread calls `object.notify()` or `object.notifyAll()` to notify the waiting thread(s).

---

### **Example** (Producer-Consumer Problem):

In the following example, a producer thread generates data, and a consumer thread consumes it. The consumer waits until the producer has produced data.

```java
class ProducerConsumer {
    private int data = 0;
    private final Object lock = new Object();

    // Producer thread
    class Producer extends Thread {
        public void run() {
            synchronized (lock) {
                while (data >= 1) {
                    try {
                        lock.wait();  // Wait if data is already produced
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    }
                }
                data = 1;  // Produce data
                System.out.println("Produced data");
                lock.notify();  // Notify consumer to consume
            }
        }
    }

    // Consumer thread
    class Consumer extends Thread {
        public void run() {
            synchronized (lock) {
                while (data == 0) {
                    try {
                        lock.wait();  // Wait for data to be produced
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    }
                }
                data = 0;  // Consume data
                System.out.println("Consumed data");
                lock.notify();  // Notify producer to produce more
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ProducerConsumer pc = new ProducerConsumer();
        Thread producer = pc.new Producer();
        Thread consumer = pc.new Consumer();

        producer.start();
        consumer.start();
    }
}
```

### **Explanation**:
- The **Producer** thread calls `lock.wait()` if the data has already been produced (i.e., `data >= 1`). This makes it wait for the **Consumer** thread to consume the data and notify the producer to produce more.
- The **Consumer** thread waits for the data to be produced (`data == 0`). When the data is produced, it calls `lock.notify()` to wake the **Producer** thread.

### **Summary**:
- The `wait()` method is used to pause the execution of a thread and release the lock it holds, allowing other threads to proceed.
- It is essential for implementing **inter-thread communication** and **synchronization**.
- A thread that calls `wait()` will remain in the waiting state until it is notified by another thread using `notify()` or `notifyAll()`.

### **Context Switching in Java (and Operating Systems)**

**Context switching** is a fundamental concept in multitasking operating systems and thread management. It refers to the process of **saving the state** of a currently running thread or process and **restoring the state** of another thread or process. This enables the operating system or Java virtual machine (JVM) to switch between different threads or processes, giving the illusion of simultaneous execution.

### **Key Aspects of Context Switching**:

1. **Saving the State**:
   - When a thread is paused (for example, when it finishes its time slice or is preempted), the operating system or JVM saves the **state** of the thread. This includes:
      - **Program Counter (PC)**: The address of the next instruction to execute.
      - **Register values**: The values in the CPU registers.
      - **Memory Management Information**: The state of the thread's memory (stack, heap, etc.).
   - This saved information is stored in a **process control block (PCB)** or **thread control block (TCB)**.

2. **Restoring the State**:
   - When a thread is scheduled to run again (after being paused), the saved state is **restored**, and the thread resumes execution from the exact point it was paused, using the previously saved values.

3. **CPU Scheduler**:
   - The **CPU scheduler** is responsible for performing context switching. It decides which thread or process should run next, based on factors like priority, round-robin scheduling, etc.

4. **Context Switching Overhead**:
   - Context switching involves some overhead due to the need to save and restore the state of a thread. The time taken to perform a context switch is often referred to as **context switch latency**.
   - Frequent context switching can lead to performance degradation, as the CPU is spending time on switching tasks rather than executing them.

### **When Does Context Switching Happen?**
Context switching occurs in the following scenarios:
- **Preemption**: When the operating system forcibly stops a running process/thread to give CPU time to another (e.g., in preemptive scheduling).
- **Voluntary Yielding**: When a thread voluntarily gives up the CPU (e.g., calling `Thread.sleep()` or `wait()`).
- **Time-Slice Expiry**: In round-robin scheduling, when a thread has used up its allotted time slice.
- **Blocking**: When a thread is waiting for resources (e.g., I/O operations) or synchronization events (e.g., `wait()`, `join()`).

### **Context Switching in Java (Multithreading)**:
In Java, **context switching** occurs when:
- A **Java thread** is paused (blocked, waiting, or yielding).
- The JVM scheduler (or the underlying operating system) decides to switch to another thread, based on thread priorities or other scheduling criteria.

Java’s `Thread.sleep()` or `wait()` methods can voluntarily cause context switching when a thread is put in a waiting or sleeping state.

### **Example** (Multithreading in Java):
Consider a scenario where two threads, A and B, are running. Java’s thread scheduler may perform context switching between these two threads.

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " - " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(100);  // Pause to allow context switching
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        MyThread t2 = new MyThread();

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

### **Explanation**:
- Both threads `t1` and `t2` will print their names and numbers.
- The `Thread.sleep(100)` method is used to simulate **voluntary yielding**, allowing context switching between `t1` and `t2`. After each thread sleeps, the CPU may give execution time to the other thread.

### **Summary**:
- **Context Switching** is the process of saving and restoring the state of threads or processes, allowing multitasking systems to switch between different tasks.
- It involves some **overhead** but is necessary for **fair CPU allocation** and **multithreading**.
- In Java, context switching is managed by the **JVM scheduler** and occurs when threads are blocked, voluntarily yielded, or preempted.

### **Difference Between notify() and notifyAll() in Java**

Both `notify()` and `notifyAll()` are methods used in **inter-thread communication** in Java, primarily to wake up threads that are waiting on an object's monitor (i.e., threads that called `wait()` on the object). However, they have distinct behaviors in how they notify waiting threads.

| **Aspect**               | **`notify()`**                                        | **`notifyAll()`**                                      |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**            | Wakes up **one** thread that is currently waiting on the object's monitor. | Wakes up **all** threads that are currently waiting on the object's monitor. |
| **Number of Threads**     | Only **one** thread is notified to wake up. If multiple threads are waiting, only one will be chosen, and which one is chosen depends on the thread scheduler. | **All** threads waiting on the monitor are notified and will attempt to acquire the lock. |
| **Use Case**              | Used when only **one** thread needs to be woken up, such as in scenarios where one waiting thread can proceed to continue the task. | Used when **all** waiting threads need to be notified, typically when they all need to perform their task after a condition is met. |
| **Behavior**              | After being notified, the **notified thread** will not immediately resume; it must first acquire the lock on the object. Once it gets the lock, it will continue its execution. | Similar to `notify()`, the threads wake up, but **all** of them will try to acquire the lock. Only one will succeed, and the others will re-enter the waiting state until they can acquire the lock. |
| **Efficiency**            | **More efficient** in scenarios where you only need to wake up one thread, preventing unnecessary context switching. | Can be **less efficient** if many threads are waiting, as it causes all threads to compete for the lock and may lead to unnecessary overhead. |
| **Example**               | Typically used when there is a single consumer and a single producer in a **producer-consumer** scenario. | Typically used when **all threads** need to react to a shared state or change, like in situations involving multiple consumers or producers. |

---

### **Detailed Explanation**:

1. **`notify()` Method**:
   - The `notify()` method wakes up **one** thread that is waiting on the object's monitor (i.e., one thread that has called `wait()` on the object).
   - The choice of which thread to wake up depends on the **thread scheduler**. This thread will then attempt to acquire the lock associated with the object.
   - **Use Case**: When only one thread needs to be notified to continue execution. For example, if a producer thread produces an item and a single consumer thread is waiting for it, `notify()` can be used to wake up the consumer.

   **Example**:

   ```java
   synchronized (obj) {
       obj.wait();  // Thread waits for notification
       obj.notify();  // Wakes up one waiting thread
   }
   ```

2. **`notifyAll()` Method**:
   - The `notifyAll()` method wakes up **all** threads that are currently waiting on the object's monitor.
   - All of the waiting threads are then allowed to compete for the lock. Once a thread acquires the lock, it will continue its execution. The other threads will wait for their turn to acquire the lock.
   - **Use Case**: When all waiting threads need to be notified to proceed. For example, in a scenario with multiple producers and consumers, `notifyAll()` might be used when any of the producers adds an item to the queue, so all consumers can attempt to consume it.

   **Example**:

   ```java
   synchronized (obj) {
       obj.wait();  // Thread waits for notification
       obj.notifyAll();  // Wakes up all waiting threads
   }
   ```

---

### **Comparison with Example (Producer-Consumer)**:

#### Scenario 1: Using `notify()`

```java
class ProducerConsumer {
    private int data = 0;
    private final Object lock = new Object();

    // Producer thread
    class Producer extends Thread {
        public void run() {
            synchronized (lock) {
                while (data >= 1) {
                    try {
                        lock.wait();  // Wait if data is already produced
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    }
                }
                data = 1;  // Produce data
                System.out.println("Produced data");
                lock.notify();  // Notify one waiting consumer
            }
        }
    }

    // Consumer thread
    class Consumer extends Thread {
        public void run() {
            synchronized (lock) {
                while (data == 0) {
                    try {
                        lock.wait();  // Wait for data to be produced
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    }
                }
                data = 0;  // Consume data
                System.out.println("Consumed data");
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ProducerConsumer pc = new ProducerConsumer();
        Thread producer = pc.new Producer();
        Thread consumer = pc.new Consumer();

        producer.start();
        consumer.start();
    }
}
```

- In this case, the producer uses `lock.notify()`, which wakes up only one waiting consumer thread, allowing it to consume the data.

#### Scenario 2: Using `notifyAll()`

```java
class ProducerConsumer {
    private int data = 0;
    private final Object lock = new Object();

    // Producer thread
    class Producer extends Thread {
        public void run() {
            synchronized (lock) {
                while (data >= 1) {
                    try {
                        lock.wait();  // Wait if data is already produced
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    }
                }
                data = 1;  // Produce data
                System.out.println("Produced data");
                lock.notifyAll();  // Notify all waiting consumers
            }
        }
    }

    // Consumer thread
    class Consumer extends Thread {
        public void run() {
            synchronized (lock) {
                while (data == 0) {
                    try {
                        lock.wait();  // Wait for data to be produced
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    }
                }
                data = 0;  // Consume data
                System.out.println("Consumed data");
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ProducerConsumer pc = new ProducerConsumer();
        Thread producer = pc.new Producer();
        Thread consumer1 = pc.new Consumer();
        Thread consumer2 = pc.new Consumer();

        producer.start();
        consumer1.start();
        consumer2.start();
    }
}
```

- In this case, the producer uses `lock.notifyAll()`, which wakes up **all waiting consumer threads**. Both consumers will compete for the lock to consume the data.

---

### **Summary**:
- **`notify()`**: Wakes up only **one** waiting thread. It is more efficient when you only need to notify a single thread to continue.
- **`notifyAll()`**: Wakes up **all** waiting threads. It is useful when you want all threads to have a chance to run after a certain condition is met. However, it may cause unnecessary overhead if there are many threads waiting.

### **Difference Between Comparable and Comparator in Java**

Both `Comparable` and `Comparator` are interfaces in Java used for **sorting objects**. They provide mechanisms to define a specific order for the objects of a class. However, there are key differences in how they are used and implemented.

| **Aspect**                     | **`Comparable`**                                          | **`Comparator`**                                          |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                     | Defines the natural order for objects of a class.        | Defines a custom order for objects, external to the class. |
| **Interface Location**          | It is located in the `java.lang` package.                 | It is located in the `java.util` package.                 |
| **Method**                       | It has a single method: `compareTo(T o)`.                 | It has a single method: `compare(T o1, T o2)`.            |
| **Comparison Basis**            | Used when a class **defines its own natural ordering** (i.e., a default order). | Used when you want to **customize the order** beyond the natural ordering. |
| **Modification of Class**       | The class whose objects are being compared **must implement** `Comparable`. | The class **does not need to implement** `Comparator`; comparison is done externally. |
| **Sorting Logic**               | The `compareTo()` method is called to compare two objects of the class. | The `compare()` method is called to compare two objects, provided by the `Comparator` class. |
| **Default Sorting Order**       | One class can have only **one natural order** defined by `compareTo()`. | Multiple different sorting orders can be defined using various `Comparator` implementations. |
| **Usage**                       | It is used when you want to sort **objects in a natural order** (for example, alphabetically for strings or numerically for numbers). | It is used when you want to define **multiple sorting orders** or **custom sorting logic**. |
| **Flexibility**                 | Less flexible: once implemented, the order cannot be easily changed. | More flexible: multiple `Comparator` implementations can provide different sorting strategies. |
| **Example**                     | `String` class implements `Comparable` to compare strings in lexicographical order. | You can create a `Comparator` to sort `Employee` objects based on salary or age. |

### **Detailed Explanation:**

1. **`Comparable` Interface**:
   - The `Comparable` interface is used to **define the natural ordering** of objects of a class. When you implement this interface, you override the `compareTo()` method to specify how objects of that class should be compared.
   - The `compareTo()` method returns:
      - **Negative** if the current object is "less than" the argument.
      - **Zero** if the current object is "equal to" the argument.
      - **Positive** if the current object is "greater than" the argument.

   - **Example (Comparable)**:

   ```java
   class Student implements Comparable<Student> {
       String name;
       int age;

       public Student(String name, int age) {
           this.name = name;
           this.age = age;
       }

       @Override
       public int compareTo(Student other) {
           // Sorting by age (ascending)
           return Integer.compare(this.age, other.age);
       }

       public String toString() {
           return name + ": " + age;
       }

       public static void main(String[] args) {
           List<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
           students.add(new Student("Alice", 22));
           students.add(new Student("Bob", 19));
           students.add(new Student("Charlie", 25));

           Collections.sort(students);  // Natural ordering by age
           System.out.println(students);
       }
   }
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   [Bob: 19, Alice: 22, Charlie: 25]
   ```

   In this example, `Student` objects are sorted by age in ascending order because `compareTo()` is implemented based on the `age` attribute.

2. **`Comparator` Interface**:
   - The `Comparator` interface is used to define **custom ordering** for objects. This allows you to provide multiple sorting strategies, even if the class does not implement `Comparable`.
   - The `compare()` method compares two objects and returns:
      - **Negative** if the first argument is "less than" the second.
      - **Zero** if both arguments are "equal".
      - **Positive** if the first argument is "greater than" the second.

   - **Example (Comparator)**:

   ```java
   class Student {
       String name;
       int age;

       public Student(String name, int age) {
           this.name = name;
           this.age = age;
       }

       public String toString() {
           return name + ": " + age;
       }

       public static void main(String[] args) {
           List<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
           students.add(new Student("Alice", 22));
           students.add(new Student("Bob", 19));
           students.add(new Student("Charlie", 25));

           // Sorting by age using Comparator
           Comparator<Student> ageComparator = new Comparator<Student>() {
               public int compare(Student s1, Student s2) {
                   return Integer.compare(s1.age, s2.age);  // Ascending order by age
               }
           };

           Collections.sort(students, ageComparator);
           System.out.println(students);
       }
   }
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   [Bob: 19, Alice: 22, Charlie: 25]
   ```

   Here, the `Comparator` provides a custom sorting strategy based on the `age` attribute, even if `Student` does not implement `Comparable`.

---

### **Key Differences Summarized**:

- **Comparable**:
   - Used for defining the **natural order** of objects.
   - Can only provide **one sorting criterion** (e.g., sort by age, or name, but not both).
   - The class itself must implement the interface and override the `compareTo()` method.

- **Comparator**:
   - Used to define **multiple custom sorting orders** for objects.
   - The class **does not need to implement** the interface.
   - Can provide different sorting strategies without modifying the class itself.

Both interfaces are essential tools for sorting objects in Java, and the choice between them depends on whether you want a natural order (`Comparable`) or need to define multiple custom orderings (`Comparator`).

### **Java 8 Features**
Java 8 introduced several new features that significantly improved the language. Here are the key features:

#### **1. Lambda Expressions**
Lambda expressions allow you to write concise and functional code by simplifying anonymous inner classes.
**Example:**
```java
// Traditional approach
interface MathOperation {
    int operation(int a, int b);
}

public class LambdaExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MathOperation addition = (a, b) -> a + b;
        System.out.println(addition.operation(10, 5)); // Output: 15
    }
}
```

#### **2. Functional Interfaces**
Java 8 introduced functional interfaces with the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation. Some built-in functional interfaces include `Predicate`, `Consumer`, and `Supplier`.
**Example:**
```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Greeting {
    void sayHello(String message);
}

public class FunctionalInterfaceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Greeting greeting = message -> System.out.println("Hello, " + message);
        greeting.sayHello("Java 8");
    }
}
```

#### **3. Default and Static Methods in Interfaces**
Interfaces can now have default and static methods.
**Example:**
```java
interface MyInterface {
    default void show() {
        System.out.println("Default Method in Interface");
    }

    static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("Static Method in Interface");
    }
}

class Demo implements MyInterface {}

public class DefaultMethodExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Demo obj = new Demo();
        obj.show(); // Calls default method
        MyInterface.staticMethod(); // Calls static method
    }
}
```

#### **4. Stream API**
Streams provide a powerful way to process collections with functional-style operations.
**Example:**
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class StreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David");
        names.stream()
             .filter(name -> name.startsWith("A"))
             .forEach(System.out::println); // Output: Alice
    }
}
```

#### **5. Optional Class**
Used to handle `null` values safely and avoid `NullPointerException`.
**Example:**
```java
import java.util.Optional;

public class OptionalExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Optional<String> optional = Optional.ofNullable(null);
        System.out.println(optional.orElse("Default Value")); // Output: Default Value
    }
}
```

#### **6. New Date and Time API**
Java 8 introduced a new `java.time` package to replace the old `Date` and `Calendar` APIs.
**Example:**
```java
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.LocalTime;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

public class DateTimeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
        LocalTime time = LocalTime.now();
        LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.now();

        System.out.println(date);
        System.out.println(time);
        System.out.println(dateTime);
    }
}
```

#### **7. Collectors Class (Part of Stream API)**
The `Collectors` utility class helps perform reduction operations such as grouping, partitioning, and collecting elements.
**Example:**
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class CollectorsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David");
        List<String> filteredNames = names.stream()
                                          .filter(name -> name.startsWith("B"))
                                          .collect(Collectors.toList());
        System.out.println(filteredNames); // Output: [Bob]
    }
}
```

#### **8. Nashorn JavaScript Engine**
Java 8 introduced the Nashorn JavaScript engine for running JavaScript code within Java applications.

#### **9. Base64 Encoding and Decoding**
Java 8 provides built-in Base64 encoding and decoding utilities.
**Example:**
```java
import java.util.Base64;

public class Base64Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String original = "Java8Features";
        String encoded = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(original.getBytes());
        String decoded = new String(Base64.getDecoder().decode(encoded));

        System.out.println("Encoded: " + encoded);
        System.out.println("Decoded: " + decoded);
    }
}
```

### **Conclusion**
Java 8 introduced functional programming concepts with lambda expressions and streams, enhanced date/time handling, and improved performance with default and static methods in interfaces. It remains one of the most significant updates in Java's history.

interface MyInterface {
    default void show() {
        commonMethod();
        System.out.println("Default Method");
    }

    private void commonMethod() {
        System.out.println("Private Method in Interface");
    }
}
```

---

### **4. Factory Methods for Collections**
Java 9 introduced static factory methods (`List.of()`, `Set.of()`, `Map.of()`) to create **immutable collections** easily.
**Example:**
```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.Map;

public class CollectionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> list = List.of("A", "B", "C");
        Set<Integer> set = Set.of(1, 2, 3);
        Map<Integer, String> map = Map.of(1, "One", 2, "Two");

        System.out.println(list);
        System.out.println(set);
        System.out.println(map);
    }
}
```
---

### **5. Stream API Enhancements**

import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

public class StreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
                .takeWhile(n -> n < 4) // Stops at first false condition
                .collect(Collectors.toList());

        System.out.println(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
    }
}
```

---

### **6. Optional Enhancements**
Java 9 added methods like `ifPresentOrElse()` and `or()` to the `Optional` class.
**Example:**
```java
import java.util.Optional;

public class OptionalExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Optional<String> optional = Optional.of("Hello Java 9");

        optional.ifPresentOrElse(
                System.out::println,
                () -> System.out.println("No Value Present")
        );
    }
}
```

---

### **7. HTTP/2 Client (New HttpClient API)**
Java 9 introduced a new **HttpClient** API to replace the old `HttpURLConnection`.
**Example:**
```java
import java.net.http.HttpClient;
import java.net.http.HttpRequest;
import java.net.http.HttpResponse;
import java.net.URI;

public class HttpClientExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
        HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
                .uri(URI.create("https://www.example.com"))
                .GET()
                .build();

        HttpResponse<String> response = client.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());

        System.out.println(response.body());
    }
}
```

---

### **8. Process API Improvements**
Java 9 introduced enhancements to the `Process` API to manage and monitor system processes more efficiently.
**Example:**
```java
import java.io.IOException;

public class ProcessExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        ProcessBuilder builder = new ProcessBuilder("notepad.exe");
        Process process = builder.start();

        System.out.println("Process PID: " + process.pid());
    }
}
```

---

### **9. Try-With-Resources Enhancement**
Java 9 allows using **final or effectively final variables** inside try-with-resources.
**Example:**
```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class TryWithResourcesExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("test.txt"));

        try (reader) { // No need to declare inside try()
            System.out.println(reader.readLine());
        }
    }
}
```

<hr style="border:1px solid orange">

### **Java 11 Features**

Java 11, released in September 2018, is an LTS (Long-Term Support) version. It introduced many enhancements, including new APIs, performance improvements, and removal of deprecated features. Here are the key features:

---

### **1. New `String` Methods**
Java 11 introduced several new methods in the `String` class for convenience.

#### **Examples:**
```java
public class StringMethodsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // isBlank(): Returns true if the string is empty or contains only white spaces
        System.out.println("  ".isBlank());  // Output: true

        // strip(): Removes leading and trailing spaces (better than trim())
        System.out.println("  Hello  ".strip());  // Output: "Hello"

        // stripLeading(): Removes leading spaces only
        System.out.println("  Hello  ".stripLeading());  // Output: "Hello  "

        // stripTrailing(): Removes trailing spaces only
        System.out.println("  Hello  ".stripTrailing());  // Output: "  Hello"

        // lines(): Converts a multiline string into a stream of lines
        String multiLine = "Hello\nWorld\nJava 11";
        multiLine.lines().forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

---

### **2. `Files.readString()` and `Files.writeString()`**
Java 11 introduced methods to **read and write files** using `java.nio.file.Files`.

#### **Example:**
```java
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;

public class FileReadWriteExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Path filePath = Path.of("sample.txt");

        // Write to file
        Files.writeString(filePath, "Hello, Java 11!");

        // Read from file
        String content = Files.readString(filePath);
        System.out.println(content);  // Output: Hello, Java 11!
    }
}
```

---

### **3. Local-Variable Syntax (`var`) in Lambda Expressions**
Java 11 allows using `var` inside lambda expressions.

#### **Example:**
```java
import java.util.List;

public class VarLambdaExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> list = List.of("Java", "11", "Features");

        list.forEach((var item) -> System.out.println(item));
    }
}
```

---

### **4. HTTP Client Becomes Standard**
The **new HTTP client** introduced in Java 9 as an incubator feature is now **fully supported in Java 11**.

#### **Example:**
```java
import java.net.http.HttpClient;
import java.net.http.HttpRequest;
import java.net.http.HttpResponse;
import java.net.URI;

public class HttpClientExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
        HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
                .uri(URI.create("https://www.example.com"))
                .GET()
                .build();

        HttpResponse<String> response = client.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
        System.out.println(response.body());
    }
}
```

---

### **5. `Optional.isEmpty()` Method**
Java 11 introduced `isEmpty()` to check if an `Optional` is empty.

#### **Example:**
```java
import java.util.Optional;

public class OptionalExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Optional<String> emptyOpt = Optional.empty();

        System.out.println(emptyOpt.isEmpty()); // Output: true
    }
}
```

---

### **6. Running Java Files Without Compilation**
With Java 11, you can run Java programs **without compiling them** using `java file.java`.
#### **Example:**
```sh
$ java Hello.java  # No need to compile with javac
```
**File: `Hello.java`**
```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Java 11!");
    }
}
```

---

### **7. Deprecated and Removed Features**
- **Removed:**
   - `java.se.ee` module (Includes JAXB, JAX-WS, CORBA, etc.).
   - `Applet API` and `JavaFX` were completely removed.

- **Deprecated:**
   - `Nashorn JavaScript Engine` (for removal in future versions).

---

### **8. `Z Garbage Collector (ZGC)`**
Java 11 introduced **ZGC**, a low-latency garbage collector designed for **large heap applications**.

#### **To enable ZGC, use:**
```sh
java -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseZGC MyApp
```

---

### **9. Flight Recorder and Mission Control**
Java 11 made **Flight Recorder** available for performance monitoring.
- Used to collect diagnostics and profiling data.
- Helps analyze application performance.

---

### Ways to Achieve Immutability in Java

Immutability means that once an object is created, its state cannot be changed. Immutable objects are particularly useful in multithreaded applications as they are inherently thread-safe. Below are several ways to achieve immutability in Java:

---

### 1. **Using the `final` Keyword**
The `final` keyword ensures that the reference of an object cannot be changed. It can be applied to classes, methods, and variables to enforce immutability.

#### Example:
```java
final String name = "John";
name = "Doe"; // Compilation error: cannot reassign final variable
```

However, `final` only prevents reassignment, not modification of the internal state of mutable objects.

---

### 2. **Creating Immutable Classes**
To make a class immutable, follow these steps:
1. Declare the class as `final` so it cannot be extended.
2. Make all fields private and final.
3. Do not provide any setters.
4. Initialize fields through a constructor.
5. If fields are mutable objects, return a defensive copy in the getter.

#### Example:
```java
final class Employee {
    private final String name;
    private final int id;

    public Employee(String name, int id) {
        this.name = name;
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }
}

// Usage
Employee e = new Employee("Alice", 123);
// e.name = "Bob"; // Compilation error: no setters
```

---

### 3. **Using Collections**
If your immutable class contains mutable collections like `List` or `Map`, return an unmodifiable or defensive copy.

#### Example:
```java
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

final class ImmutableClass {
    private final List<String> items;

    public ImmutableClass(List<String> items) {
        this.items = Collections.unmodifiableList(items); // Return unmodifiable list
    }

    public List<String> getItems() {
        return items; // Already unmodifiable
    }
}
```

---

### 4. **Using Wrapper Classes**
Java provides built-in immutable wrapper classes for primitive types, like `Integer`, `Double`, and `Boolean`. Use these classes to work with immutable values.

#### Example:
```java
Integer num = Integer.valueOf(10); // Immutable wrapper class
```

---

### 5. **Using String**
The `String` class in Java is inherently immutable. Use `String` instead of mutable alternatives like `StringBuilder` when immutability is required.

#### Example:
```java
String str = "Hello";
str = str.concat(" World"); // Creates a new String object; the original is unchanged
```

---

### 6. **Using Records (Java 14+)**
From Java 14 onwards, you can use `record` to create immutable data classes automatically.

#### Example:
```java
public record Employee(String name, int id) {}
```

`record` automatically creates:
- Final fields
- A constructor
- Getters
- A `toString()`, `equals()`, and `hashCode()` implementation

---

### 7. **Using Static Factory Methods**
Static factory methods can help maintain immutability by creating new objects rather than modifying the existing ones.

#### Example:
```java
import java.util.List;

public final class Person {
    private final String name;

    private Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public static Person create(String name) {
        return new Person(name);
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}

// Usage
Person p1 = Person.create("Alice");
Person p2 = Person.create("Bob");
```

---

### 8. **Defensive Copy**
If your class contains mutable fields (e.g., `Date`, `ArrayList`), ensure immutability by returning defensive copies in getters and constructors.

#### Example:
```java
import java.util.Date;

final class ImmutableClass {
    private final Date date;

    public ImmutableClass(Date date) {
        this.date = new Date(date.getTime()); // Defensive copy
    }

    public Date getDate() {
        return new Date(date.getTime()); // Defensive copy
    }
}

// Usage
Date date = new Date();
ImmutableClass immutable = new ImmutableClass(date);
date.setTime(123456789); // Does not affect the immutable object
System.out.println(immutable.getDate());
```

---

### 9. **Immutable Collections (Java 9+)**
From Java 9 onwards, you can create immutable collections using `List.of()`, `Set.of()`, and `Map.of()`.

#### Example:
```java
List<String> list = List.of("A", "B", "C"); // Immutable list
list.add("D"); // Throws UnsupportedOperationException
```

### Summary of Techniques:
| **Technique**                     | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `final` keyword                   | Prevent reassignment of variables.                                             |
| Immutable Classes                 | Use `final` fields, no setters, and defensive copying.                         |
| Built-in Immutable Classes        | Use `String`, `Integer`, `List.of()`, etc.                                     |
| Records (Java 14+)                | Easily create immutable data classes.                                          |
| Defensive Copy                    | Return copies of mutable objects in constructors and getters.                  |
| Static Factory Methods            | Ensure object creation is controlled and new instances are always returned.    |

By following these techniques, you can ensure that your objects are immutable, making your code thread-safe, reliable, and easier to maintain.

### Private Methods in Interfaces

In Java 9, private methods were introduced in interfaces to allow code reusability within the interface. These methods help avoid code duplication in default and static methods.

#### **Key Points:**
1. **Cannot be accessed outside the interface** – Private methods are only accessible within the interface.
2. **Useful for code reusability** – They help reduce redundancy in default and static methods.
3. **Cannot be abstract** – Private methods must have a body.
4. **Can be static or instance methods** – A private method can be either a static or an instance method.

#### **Syntax:**

##### **1. Private Instance Method:**
```java
interface MyInterface {
    default void show() {
        System.out.println("Default Method");
        commonLogic();
    }

    private void commonLogic() {
        System.out.println("Common Logic inside Private Method");
    }
}
```

##### **2. Private Static Method:**
```java
interface MyInterface {
    static void display() {
        System.out.println("Static Method");
        staticHelper();
    }

    private static void staticHelper() {
        System.out.println("Common Logic inside Private Static Method");
    }
}
```

#### **Example Usage:**
```java
class Demo implements MyInterface {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Demo obj = new Demo();
        obj.show(); // Calls the default method
        MyInterface.display(); // Calls the static method
    }
}
```
#### **Output:**
```
Default Method
Common Logic inside Private Method
Static Method
Common Logic inside Private Static Method
```

#### **Benefits of Private Methods in Interfaces:**
- **Encapsulation**: Hides unnecessary implementation details from interface users.
- **Code Reusability**: Prevents duplication by using common logic inside private methods.
- **Improved Readability**: Keeps the interface clean and modular.

Before Java 9, achieving the same functionality required creating utility classes or default method hacks. Private methods simplify this by allowing helper methods directly inside interfaces.

### Replacing String[] args with Variable Arguments in Java

In Java, we can replace `String[] args` with **varargs (`String... args`)** to make method parameters more flexible.

---

### **What is Varargs (`...`)?**
- Varargs (`...`) allows a method to take **zero or more arguments** of the same type.
- It **replaces arrays (`[]`)** when we are not sure how many arguments will be passed.
- Internally, Java converts varargs into an array.

---

### **Replacing `String[] args` with `String... args` in `main()` Method**

By default, the `main()` method in Java looks like this:
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, " + args[0]);
}
```
This method requires an **explicit array** (`String[]`).

We can replace it with **varargs (`String... args`)** like this:
```java
public static void main(String... args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, " + args[0]);
}
```
Both versions work the same way because **Java treats `String... args` as `String[] args` internally**.

---

### **Example: Using Varargs in a Method**
```java
class Demo {
    // Using varargs instead of array
    static void printNames(String... names) {
        for (String name : names) {
            System.out.println(name);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String... args) {
        printNames("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
        printNames("John");
        printNames(); // Works fine, prints nothing
    }
}
```
### **Output:**
```
Alice
Bob
Charlie
John
```
**Note:** It works even if we pass **zero, one, or multiple arguments**.

---

### **Key Differences: `String[] args` vs. `String... args`**

| Feature | `String[] args` | `String... args` |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Syntax | Requires an explicit array | More flexible, allows direct arguments |
| Functionality | Must pass an array explicitly | Can pass values directly |
| Readability | Less readable | More concise & cleaner |
| Use Case | Used in standard `main()` method | Useful for flexible method parameters |

---

### **When to Use Varargs?**
✅ When the number of parameters **is unknown**.
✅ When you want to make the method **more flexible**.
✅ When calling the method should be **simpler and cleaner**.

However, **Java’s `main()` method is always called with `String[] args`**, so replacing it with `String... args` **only improves readability but does not change behavior**.

### volatile Keyword in Java

The `volatile` keyword in Java is used to **ensure visibility and ordering of variable updates across multiple threads**. It is mainly used in **multi-threading** to prevent threads from caching a variable, ensuring that they always read the latest value from the main memory.

---

### **Why Do We Need `volatile`?**

In Java, threads may cache variables for better performance, meaning changes made by one thread may not be visible to others. The `volatile` keyword ensures:

1. **Visibility** – All threads **read the latest value** directly from main memory.
2. **Prevents Reordering** – The compiler **does not reorder** volatile variable operations, maintaining execution order.

---

### **Example Without `volatile` (Leads to Issue)**

```java
class SharedData {
    static boolean flag = false;

    static void printMessage() {
        while (!flag) {
            // Loop runs infinitely as thread may cache 'flag'
        }
        System.out.println("Flag updated, exiting loop...");
    }
}
```
🔴 If `flag` is updated by another thread, it **might not be visible** due to caching.

---

### **Example With `volatile` (Fixes the Issue)**

```java
class SharedData {
    static volatile boolean flag = false; // Ensures visibility

    static void printMessage() {
        while (!flag) {
            // Always checks latest 'flag' value from memory
        }
        System.out.println("Flag updated, exiting loop...");
    }
}
```
✅ The `volatile` keyword ensures that when **one thread updates `flag`**, all other threads **immediately see the change**.

---

### **Key Properties of `volatile`**
✔ **Ensures Visibility** – The latest value is always read from memory.
✔ **Prevents Instruction Reordering** – Guarantees correct execution order.
❌ **Does Not Guarantee Atomicity** – `volatile` **does not** prevent race conditions when multiple threads modify a variable.

---

### **When to Use `volatile`?**
✅ When multiple threads **read and write a shared variable**.
✅ When operations on a variable **do not depend on its previous value** (e.g., `flag = true`).
✅ When you do **not need locking (`synchronized`)** but need visibility guarantees.

---

### **Limitations of `volatile`**
🚫 **Does not provide atomicity** – For operations like `count++`, use **`synchronized` or `AtomicInteger`** instead.
🚫 **Not suitable for complex operations** – Use **locks (`synchronized`, `Lock` API)** for more control.

**Example of Incorrect Use:**
```java
class Counter {
    volatile int count = 0;

    void increment() {
        count++; // Not atomic! Two threads can cause race condition.
    }
}
```
✅ **Fix:** Use `AtomicInteger`:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

class Counter {
    AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);

    void increment() {
        count.incrementAndGet(); // Ensures atomicity
    }
}
```

---

### **Conclusion**
The `volatile` keyword is used in multi-threading to ensure **visibility and ordering of variable updates**. However, it **does not provide atomicity**, so for complex operations, **synchronized or atomic variables should be used** instead.

### Can You Write a Functional Interface Without an Abstract Method in Java?

No, a **functional interface** in Java **must have exactly one abstract method**. If an interface does not have any abstract methods, it **cannot** be considered a functional interface.

---

### **What is a Functional Interface?**
A **functional interface** is an interface that has **only one abstract method** and can be used with **lambda expressions**. It may have multiple **default or static methods**, but only one abstract method.

✅ **Example of a Functional Interface (Correct Way)**
```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface MyFunctionalInterface {
    void show(); // One abstract method (Required)

    default void display() {
        System.out.println("Default method");
    }
}
```
Here, `show()` is the **only abstract method**, so it's a valid functional interface.

---

### **What Happens If There Is No Abstract Method?**

🔴 **If an interface has only default and static methods (no abstract method), it is NOT a functional interface.**
Example:
```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface InvalidFunctionalInterface {
    default void method1() {
        System.out.println("Default method");
    }

    static void method2() {
        System.out.println("Static method");
    }
}
```
🚨 **This will cause a compilation error because there is no abstract method.**

---

### **Key Rules for Functional Interfaces:**
✔ **Must have exactly one abstract method.**
✔ Can have multiple **default or static methods**.
✔ Can extend other interfaces, but must still have only **one** abstract method.

---

### **Conclusion**
❌ **You cannot write a functional interface without an abstract method** because a functional interface **must contain one and only one abstract method** to be used with lambda expressions.

### When Should We Use Default and Static Methods in Java?

Java introduced **default methods** and **static methods** in interfaces from **Java 8** to enhance code reusability while maintaining backward compatibility.

---

### **1. Default Methods in Interfaces**

✅ **Use Default Methods When:**
1. **Adding New Methods to an Interface Without Breaking Existing Implementations**
   - Before Java 8, adding a method to an interface **broke** all existing implementations.
   - With **default methods**, we can provide a default implementation without breaking existing classes.

2. **Providing a Common Implementation for Multiple Classes**
   - When multiple implementing classes need a **shared behavior**, default methods reduce code duplication.

3. **Allowing Implementing Classes to Override If Needed**
   - Implementing classes can either **use** the default method or **override** it with their own implementation.

✅ **Example: Default Method in an Interface**
```java
interface Vehicle {
    void start();

    default void stop() { // Default method with implementation
        System.out.println("Vehicle is stopping...");
    }
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car is starting...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle car = new Car();
        car.start();
        car.stop(); // Uses default implementation
    }
}
```
👉 The `Car` class **inherits** the `stop()` method without implementing it.

---

### **2. Static Methods in Interfaces**

✅ **Use Static Methods When:**
1. **Utility or Helper Methods That Do Not Depend on Instance Data**
   - If a method is only performing calculations or providing utility functions, it should be `static`.

2. **Preventing Implementing Classes from Overriding a Method**
   - Unlike default methods, **static methods cannot be overridden**.

3. **Ensuring a Method Belongs to the Interface, Not the Implementing Class**
   - Static methods are called using **Interface Name**, not an object.

✅ **Example: Static Method in an Interface**
```java
interface MathUtils {
    static int square(int x) { // Static method
        return x * x;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int result = MathUtils.square(5); // Calling static method
        System.out.println(result); // Output: 25
    }
}
```
👉 **`square()` belongs to the `MathUtils` interface** and cannot be overridden.

---

### **Key Differences Between Default and Static Methods**

| Feature              | Default Method           | Static Method |
|----------------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| Can be overridden?  | ✅ Yes, implementing classes can override it | ❌ No, static methods cannot be overridden |
| Requires an instance? | ✅ Yes, called on an instance | ❌ No, called using the interface name |
| Used for? | Providing default behavior for implementing classes | Utility/helper methods that don’t need instance data |
| Called by? | Implementing class instance | Interface name |

---

### **Conclusion**
✔ **Use Default Methods** when you need to add new behavior to an interface **without breaking existing implementations**.
✔ **Use Static Methods** for **utility functions** that do not depend on instance variables and **cannot be overridden**.

🚀 **Both features make Java interfaces more powerful and flexible!**

### equals() and hashCode() Contract in Java

In Java, the `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods are used for **object comparison** and **hash-based collections** (like `HashMap`, `HashSet`). These methods must follow a specific contract to ensure correct behavior.

---

### **1. The equals() Method**
- The `equals()` method is used to **compare two objects for equality**.
- The default implementation (`Object.equals()`) checks **reference equality** (`==`), but we can override it for **custom comparison**.

✅ **Example: Overriding `equals()`**
```java
class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj) return true; // Check same reference
        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;
        Person person = (Person) obj;
        return age == person.age && name.equals(person.name); // Compare values
    }
}
```
👉 **Now, two `Person` objects are equal if their `name` and `age` are the same.**

---

### **2. The hashCode() Method**
- The `hashCode()` method **returns an integer (hash code) for an object**.
- It is used in **hash-based collections** (`HashMap`, `HashSet`) for **efficient lookup**.

✅ **Example: Overriding `hashCode()`**
```java
@Override
public int hashCode() {
    return Objects.hash(name, age); // Generates a hash code based on fields
}
```
👉 The `hashCode()` ensures that objects with **equal values produce the same hash code**.

---

### **3. The equals() and hashCode() Contract**

✅ **Rules that must be followed**:

1. **If `equals()` returns `true`, `hashCode()` must be the same for both objects.**
   ```java
   Person p1 = new Person("Alice", 25);
   Person p2 = new Person("Alice", 25);
   System.out.println(p1.equals(p2));  // true
   System.out.println(p1.hashCode() == p2.hashCode());  // true ✅
   ```

2. **If `equals()` returns `false`, `hashCode()` can be different, but it's not mandatory.**
   ```java
   Person p1 = new Person("Alice", 25);
   Person p2 = new Person("Bob", 30);
   System.out.println(p1.equals(p2));  // false
   System.out.println(p1.hashCode() != p2.hashCode());  // Usually true
   ```

3. **If `hashCode()` is different, `equals()` must return `false`.**

4. **If `hashCode()` is the same, `equals()` may return `true` or `false`** (different objects can have the same hash code, but equals should differentiate them).

---

### **4. Why is the Contract Important?**

🔹 Ensures **correct behavior** in collections like `HashMap`, `HashSet`, `HashTable`.
🔹 Avoids **duplicate keys** in `HashMap` and **incorrect lookups** in `HashSet`.

✅ **Example: Using in `HashSet`**
```java
Set<Person> people = new HashSet<>();
people.add(new Person("Alice", 25));
System.out.println(people.contains(new Person("Alice", 25))); // true ✅
```
👉 Without a proper `equals()` and `hashCode()`, `contains()` might return `false` **even if an equal object exists in the set**.

---

### **Conclusion**
✔ **`equals()` checks object equality, while `hashCode()` provides an efficient way to store and retrieve objects.**
✔ **If two objects are equal, their hash codes must also be equal.**
✔ **Always override both methods together to ensure correct behavior in collections.**

🚀 **Following the contract makes Java collections work efficiently!**

### Difference Between Runnable and Callable in Java

Both `Runnable` and `Callable` are used to execute tasks in **multithreading** but have key differences in how they return results and handle exceptions.

---

### **1. Runnable Interface**
- Introduced in **Java 1.0**.
- Does **not** return a result (`void`).
- Cannot throw checked exceptions.
- Used with `Thread` or `ExecutorService`.

✅ **Example: Runnable Implementation**
```java
class MyTask implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Executing task in Runnable");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(new MyTask());
        thread.start();
    }
}
```
👉 **No return value** from `run()`, and we cannot throw checked exceptions.

---

### **2. Callable Interface**
- Introduced in **Java 5** (`java.util.concurrent`).
- Returns a **result** (`Generic<T>`).
- Can **throw checked exceptions**.
- Used with `ExecutorService` and `Future`.

✅ **Example: Callable Implementation**
```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

class MyTask implements Callable<String> {
    @Override
    public String call() throws Exception {
        return "Task completed";
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1);
        Future<String> future = executor.submit(new MyTask());
        System.out.println(future.get()); // Waits and gets result
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```
👉 `Callable` allows **returning a result** and **throwing exceptions**.

---

### **3. Key Differences**

| Feature        | Runnable                  | Callable |
|---------------|---------------------------|----------|
| **Introduced In** | Java 1.0 | Java 5 |
| **Return Type** | `void` (No result) | `T` (Generic result) |
| **Exception Handling** | Cannot throw checked exceptions | Can throw checked exceptions |
| **Used With** | `Thread`, `ExecutorService` | `ExecutorService`, `Future` |
| **Execution** | `run()` method | `call()` method |

---

### **4. When to Use Runnable vs Callable?**

✅ **Use `Runnable`** when:
- The task does **not need a return value**.
- No checked exceptions need to be handled.
- Simple background tasks (e.g., logging, periodic jobs).

✅ **Use `Callable`** when:
- The task **needs a return value**.
- You **expect checked exceptions**.
- Used in thread pools where results are needed (`Future.get()`).

---

### **Conclusion**
✔ **Runnable** is simpler but cannot return a value.
✔ **Callable** is more powerful, allowing results and exceptions.
✔ Use **Runnable for simple tasks** and **Callable when you need results or exception handling**.

🚀 **Callable is better for complex, result-driven tasks!**

### In Java, static as well as private method overriding is possible. Comment on the statement.

The statement is **incorrect** because **static and private methods cannot be overridden in Java**. Here's why:

---

### **1. Can Static Methods Be Overridden?**
❌ **No, static methods cannot be overridden.**

🔹 In Java, **method overriding** is based on **dynamic method dispatch (runtime polymorphism)**, which only works with **instance methods**.
🔹 **Static methods belong to the class** (not the object), so they are **resolved at compile-time**, not runtime.
🔹 Instead of **overriding**, static methods are **hidden** if redefined in a subclass.

✅ **Example: Method Hiding (Not Overriding)**
```java
class Parent {
    static void show() {
        System.out.println("Static method in Parent");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    static void show() { // This is method hiding, not overriding
        System.out.println("Static method in Child");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent obj = new Child();
        obj.show(); // Output: Static method in Parent (method hiding, not overriding)
    }
}
```
👉 Even though `obj` is of type `Child`, the **Parent's static method is called** because static methods are resolved at **compile-time**.

---

### **2. Can Private Methods Be Overridden?**
❌ **No, private methods cannot be overridden.**

🔹 A **private method is not inherited** by subclasses, so **there is no concept of overriding it**.
🔹 If a subclass defines a method with the same name as a private method in the parent class, it is simply **a new method (not an overridden method).**

✅ **Example: Private Method in Parent Class**
```java
class Parent {
    private void display() {
        System.out.println("Private method in Parent");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    private void display() { // This is a new method, not an override
        System.out.println("Private method in Child");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent obj = new Child();
        // obj.display(); // ❌ Error: display() is private and not accessible
    }
}
```
👉 The `display()` method in `Child` is **not overriding** the method in `Parent`. It is a **new, independent method** that only exists within `Child`.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
✔ **Static methods cannot be overridden**; they are only **hidden**.
✔ **Private methods cannot be overridden** because they **are not inherited**.
✔ **Only non-static, non-private instance methods can be overridden** in Java.

🚀 **Best Practice:**
- Use **static methods** for utility functions that do not depend on object state.
- Avoid naming a private method the same as a superclass method to prevent confusion.
- Use **method overriding only with public or protected instance methods** for polymorphic behavior.

### Java Works as "Pass by Value" or "Pass by Reference"?

Java **always** follows **pass by value**, not pass by reference. However, the way **objects and primitive data types** behave makes it seem confusing.

---

### **1. Primitive Data Types (Pass by Value)**
🔹 When you pass a **primitive type** (`int`, `double`, `char`, etc.), Java **creates a copy** of the value.
🔹 Changes inside the method **do not affect** the original variable.

✅ **Example (Pass by Value for Primitives):**
```java
class Test {
    void modify(int x) {
        x = 100; // This change is local to this method
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 50;
        Test obj = new Test();
        obj.modify(num);
        System.out.println(num); // Output: 50 (original value is unchanged)
    }
}
```
👉 Even though `x` is modified inside `modify()`, the original `num` remains **unchanged** because Java passes a **copy of the value**.

---

### **2. Objects (Pass by Value of Reference)**
🔹 When passing an **object**, Java still passes **by value**, but it passes **the value of the reference (memory address)**, not the actual object.
🔹 This means modifications **inside the object’s state** will reflect outside the method, but changing the reference itself will not.

✅ **Example (Pass by Value of Reference):**
```java
class Data {
    int value = 50;
}

class Test {
    void modify(Data obj) {
        obj.value = 100; // Modifies the original object's value
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Data data = new Data();
        Test obj = new Test();
        obj.modify(data);
        System.out.println(data.value); // Output: 100 (value is changed)
    }
}
```
👉 The `modify()` method **changes the object’s state**, so the modification is visible outside the method.

---

### **3. Changing Object Reference (Does Not Affect Original Object)**
🔹 If you **reassign** the reference inside a method, it **does not affect** the original reference.

✅ **Example:**
```java
class Data {
    int value = 50;
}

class Test {
    void modify(Data obj) {
        obj = new Data(); // New object created, original reference remains unchanged
        obj.value = 100;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Data data = new Data();
        Test obj = new Test();
        obj.modify(data);
        System.out.println(data.value); // Output: 50 (original object remains unchanged)
    }
}
```
👉 Here, `modify()` creates a **new object**, but since Java passes **only the reference value**, the **original reference remains unchanged**.

---

### **Conclusion**
✔ **Java is always pass by value**, even for objects.
✔ **For primitives**, a copy of the value is passed (changes inside the method do not affect the original).
✔ **For objects**, the reference value is passed (modifying the object’s state affects the original, but reassigning the reference does not).

🚀 **Rule of Thumb:**
- **Primitives** → Value is copied → **Original remains unchanged**.
- **Objects** → Reference value is copied → **State changes, but reference change does not reflect**.
